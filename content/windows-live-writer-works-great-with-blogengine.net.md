Just experimenting a bit with using [Windows Live Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/) as a publishing tool for [BlogEngine.Net](http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/). So far, it works really nicely. For one thing, it respects the theme of the blog right in the editing environment. Check it out:

That’s a local app you are looking at above, not this web site. After putting a screen shot in my post, it looks like a mirror reflecting a mirror. :)

The upside of using a local program for editing is faster saving of drafts plus nice conveniences like spell-checking. (I find the WYSIWYG editor in BlogEngine to be a little wonky, as such things often are.)

I didn’t know the [blog API’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaWeblog) were that advanced. Great stuff.
