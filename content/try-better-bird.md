I created a [Chrome extension](//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dolfbfbhjniibjlmpebhdkjanjlcnolp?hl=en-US) to fix what I think are some rough edges and poor choices in the Twitter web app. Have a look:

Some things it does:

*   Moves the content to the left side, where it should be.
*   Resolves t.co, bit.ly and other shortened links, so you know where you are clicking.
*   Widens the content and optionally uses a nicer font.
*   Exposes your Saved Searches, which are otherwise obscured, and notifies you of new matches.

Each of these things is configurable. My design intention is to subtly help but otherwise stay out of the way.

Let me know what you think, or (better yet) leave a review on the Chrome Web Store. It’s [here](//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dolfbfbhjniibjlmpebhdkjanjlcnolp?hl=en).
