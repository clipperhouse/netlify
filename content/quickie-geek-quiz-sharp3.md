Alright, today’s geek question relates to branding:

_Which company trademarked the brand name “Heroin”?_

_Bonus: under what circumstances did they lose that trademark?_

No Googling! Honor system ‘round here. Answer in the comments.

A couple of hints. Happened over 100 years ago. The company invented and owned the trademark for another common drug that’s sitting in your medicine cabinet right now, and lost that trademark for the same reason.

—

Fernando for the win! It was Bayer. They lost the trademark after Germany lost WWI, along with “Aspirin”.
