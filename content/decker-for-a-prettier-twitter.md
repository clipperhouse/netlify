I made a Chrome extension which makes Twitter.com’s UX more tolerable, called [decker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/decker/jiooocaggnohgjapeljmhoeljemddapj). It:

*   Widens the content area and removes the columns with “Trends” and “Who to follow”, etc.
*   Resolves (i.e., removes) the t.co redirects. You’ll go directly to the URL in a tweet.
*   Auto-loads new tweets instead of showing you the “N new tweets” bar. Pro tip: if you are scrolled down the page it will not auto-load new tweets, to avoid annoying scroll jumps.
*   Removes “Moments” from the nav.

The source code is [here on GitHub](https://github.com/clipperhouse/decker).
