[This article](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/21/how-the-iphone-is-blowing-everyone-else-away-in-charts/) over a TechCrunch is putatively about the iPhone, but the take-away for me is that AT&amp;T’s data traffic has grown 50-fold over the last 3 years:

It’s easy to complain about AT&amp;T’s network, etc, because people like to bitch. But I am not aware of any data service that has ever scaled up that quickly.

And one wonders what Verizon’s aggregate data traffic looks like. I imagine it’s a fraction of AT&amp;T’s, because Verizon just doesn’t carry handsets with the popularity and capability of the iPhone. It’s considered conventional wisdom that Verizon’s network is better, when in fact, it’s untested.
