title: "Will Apple emulate the “Kindle everywhere” strategy?"

I like the concept of e-books, if not their current state-of-the-art. The Kindle device sounds very impressive, I’ve only played with them a bit, and I know they have a lot of devoted fans.

One thing that gets underplayed is that “Kindle” is not simply a device, it’s Amazon’s e-book platform. So instead of spending $300 on the device, I am using the free [Kindle for PC](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=kcp_pc_mkt_lnd?docId=1000426311) application. (There is also an iPhone version but jeez, that’s pushing it in terms of readability.)

Amazon has decided it’s not going to restrict its e-book effort to a particular piece of hardware — instead, it’s a “Kindle everywhere” strategy. I wonder — will Apple do the same?

In other words, when (if) Apple introduces their [publishing-oriented](/blog/post/Questions-about-the-Apple-tablet-that-no-one-is-answering-yet.aspx) tablet, will they simultaneously announce that you can get the e-reader software on your PC? There is a precedent — it’s called iTunes.

I suspect that this publication platform will use iTunes as its hub, and treat publications just like the media it already handles — books and magazines alongside songs, movies and podcasts. You can play those media on your PC just as easily as you can on the iPod. (And if they [put it in the cloud](http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/19/apples-secret-cloud-strategy-and-why-lala-is-critical/), all the better.)

If this comes to pass, you’ll be able to take advantage of the tablet’s e-reader functionality, without buying an expensive, first-generation device. Win.
