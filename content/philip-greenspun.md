…is someone I hadn’t heard of until I read this very amusing post: [Ruby on Rails and the importance of being stupid](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2009/05/18/ruby-on-rails-and-the-importance-of-being-stupid/). The comments are every bit as interesting as the article.

I like his [economic thinking](http://philip.greenspun.com/politics/economic-recovery) too, with obligatory reference to the excellent [The Forgotten Man](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060936428?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=clipperhouse-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0060936428), which I am now “reading” (ie, glancing at, half-finished, on my desk).

I was a physics major, not a computer science guy. Turns out physics is great training for the problem-solving that programmers do. I was surprised by what Philip [had to say about computer science](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2007/08/23/improving-undergraduate-computer-science-education/), not least that most CS graduates are not good programmers and that MIT apparently doesn’t offer a course on databases?

Having not taken CS, I’ve wondered what they teach. Is it low-level how-does-RAM-work type stuff? Because most of the practicable skills I see in programmers come from experience, even if they have the degree. Seems to me a person with a technical mind, motivation, and a grounding in math could become a very good programmer in about two focused years.

To be a great programmer, s/he would also have to be a [linguist](/blog/post/Nulls-and-knowledge.aspx). :)
