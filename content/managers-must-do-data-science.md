Data science (your definition here) is a necessity not just for “data” projects but for management. Data science, properly understood, is our best tool for understanding what is true, and how confident we should be in our decisions.

These things sounds like what we pay managers for, and they are. Many managers are metrics driven, to their credit. Data science adds a new dimension, and managers who are not conversant in it will be…not good managers.

### Ending conflict

We’ve all been in long arguments about what the best feature is. Why are they such long arguments? Because they are dogmatic and subjective.

This is something of a tautology — that an argument is long and unresolved means that we lack the tools to resolve it, short of deferring to the boss or some other decider. This is especially true in design.

Deferring to the decider is a political solution, and end-users are the worse for it.
