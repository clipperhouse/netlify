Since moving from Cali to NY, I’ve come to miss my favorite radio station, KDFC. They rule, especially Hoyt Smith on my clock radio in the morning.

So I [stream it](http://www.kdfc.com/pages/743368.php) via iTunes on the PC. Sounds great even if I can’t wake up to it.

But the iPhone doesn’t do Internet radio easily. It has the capability of streaming audio, but only through a [roundabout process](http://www.intomobile.com/2009/06/16/iphone-os-30-can-stream-internet-radio-in-the-background.html) or some [unintuitive app](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=289088708&amp;mt=8).

So (Apple), please:

*   Create a simple Internet Radio app, with a catalog similar to what we have in iTunes on the desktop.
*   Make it one-tap to fire up a station, perhaps by allowing bookmarks to be added to the home screen. They are just URLs, after all. And a screen of favorites within the app.
*   And heck, update the desktop iTunes with similar features. Sync favorites between the iPhone and the desktop.
