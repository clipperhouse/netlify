### Thank you

As of December 2016 we have shut down Alikewise.com. We are thrilled with the response to the site and we hope you found romance, or at least a good read.

We started in 2010 with the belief that books are a great conversation starter. We helped tens of thousands of people to interact over their shared interests. Perhaps you were one of them!

(We got some [nice press](#press) over the years, too.)

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me (Matt Sherman) at my personal email mwsherman@gmail.com or [on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/clipperhouse).

Best of love,  
Matt and Matt
