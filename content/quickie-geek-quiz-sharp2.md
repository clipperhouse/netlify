OK, I might or might not give out a prize like [last time](/blog/post/Quickie-geek-quiz-1.aspx). Times are tight, y’know. Impress me and we’ll see. The question is:

_What is the difference between a meteor and a meteorite?_

Bonus points for describing what the term “meteor” refers to, precisely.

No Googling! Honor system. Please answer in the comments.

Update: Russ is a winner! I believe that meteor specifically refers to the streak of light in the sky, as opposed to the object itself. The term was coined before the cause was known. Meteors were thought to be weather phenomena, thus “meteorology”.
