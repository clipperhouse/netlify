title: "Championship"

Engineering and product managers often talk about “ownership” of features, when what we want is **championship**. When we orient ourselves around _assignment_ of tasks, we ship a worse product.

We should want individuals to choose projects that they will **champion**, i.e., for which they are **advocates**. This is better for the individual, better for the user, better for the company – and it keeps us managers accountable.

### Intrinsic motivation

People do better work when they are intrinsically motivated. In engineering, this means better correctness, better performance, more edge cases discovered and addressed. We incentivise craftsmanship: when the implementer cares, the user gets a better product.

In my unscientific observation, *championed* work ships product that is 2× better than “assigned” work. This makes for happier, more invested developers, who stick around.

### Keeping managers accountable

When deciding priorities, we managers are more hand-wavy than we’d like to think. Championship provides a empirical test for our hypotheses.

What if we’ve proposed a project and declared its priority, and yet found no takers? The absence of a champion is an opportunity to **debug our beliefs**.

- Did our idea just fail its first market test – with a friendly audience, no less?
- Did we fail to persuade? Persuasion is an obligation of leadership.
- Did we commit to other priorities, therefore making this new priority…not?

Up next, how we did it on my team at Stack Overflow.
