Engineering and product organizations often talk about “ownership” of features, and I think this is mediocre. It sounds like a burden. When we orient ourselves around *assigning* work – a natural, traditional orientation – we leave money on the table.

We managers should want individual contributors to work only on projects that they **champion**. This is not simply good for developers; it keeps us managers accountable…

### 1: Better product

What motivated me to implement this on my team at Stack: **intrinsic motivation** makes for better product. Probably 2× better.

Because the engineer *wants* the project to ship, a better product will ship. The performance will be better, the tests will be better, more edge cases will be discovered and handled.

Intrinsically-motivated – championed! – work ships better product than “assigned” work. Synonmously, this makes for happier, more invested developers.

### 2: Accountable managers

When deciding priorities, we managers are more hand-wavy than we’d like to think. A championship standard provides a initial, empirical test for our hypotheses.

What if we’ve queued up a project and declared its priority, and yet found no takers? Excellent question.

### 3: Debugging

The absence of a champion for a project can mean many things. It’s an opportunity to debug our beliefs.

- Did we commit to other things that we called priorities, therefore making this new priority…not?
- Did we explain ourselves poorly? Persuasion is an obligation of leadership.
- Did our idea just fail its first market test – with a friendly audience, no less?

## How we did it at Stack Overflow

On my team at Stack, developers would choose to champion projects at the beginning of each sprint. This is the planning process; there is no “assignment”.

Leading up to each sprint planning session, the product managers queue up possible projects for the sprint. It’s on them to make each candidate clear, compelling and specific enough to make decision about.

Pitching, socialization and advocacy is encouraged! Then, during the planning meeting, each project seeks a champion.
