One would think, after [announcing](http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20090721comp.htm?cid=rss-90004-c1-236380) the product in July, that Intel might be shipping its next-gen solid state hard drives. One would be [wrong](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B002IJA1EG/ref=ord_cart_shr?_encoding=UTF8&amp;m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;v=glance).

I think one of the biggest uses of these drives will be to resuscitate old machines that would otherwise be tossed. A four-year-old CPU is still faster than what most people need, but if you swap out the slowest part of the machine (the disk), you might find you have a perfectly good netbook.
