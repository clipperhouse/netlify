Neat, Google has a [new language called Go](http://golang.org/doc/go_tutorial.html). Clever branding, that.

It seems to be Google’s attempt to step into the Java/C# space. Perhaps I don’t know enough about languages to make such an assertion, but the thing that clued me in was its **type safety**. That seems decidedly [untrendy](http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html).

Google seems to have [stepped over](http://golang.org/doc/go_lang_faq.html#inheritance) a basic OO concept: inheritance. Smart C# programmers know to use interfaces instead of inheritance, where possible. It’s an important way to keep coupling as loose as possible. (I am an intermediate C# guy, so that means I do it often but not often enough.)

Go only uses interfaces — no inheritance — and it does this [by design](http://golang.org/doc/go_faq.html#Is_Go_an_object-oriented_language).
