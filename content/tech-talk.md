The world of technology can be overwhelming — so much jargon and ever-changing markets.

[Matt Sherman](/about/) specializes in explaining the technical landscape to folks in non-technical roles, especially technical recruiting and sales.

## Whirlwind tour

Matt offers an introductory tour to get a handle on technology jargon and ecosystems. We cover such questions as:

- What do programmers do exactly?
- Why are there so many programming languages?
- What is Java? Is it the same as JavaScript?
- What is a database?
- What do data scientists do?
- What is ‘front-end’ vs ‘back-end’?
- What is devops?

This interactive session takes around an hour, and is customized for the audience. It is intended to be conversational, with lots of detours for audience questions.

## Tech recruiting boot camp

You’ve been asked to hire technical people: engineers, data scientists, systems administrators. It’s a tough job in a competitive market.

Matt will work with you to understand this landscape, and most importantly, to improve your credibility with candidates. We’ll develop your strategies for attracting the right talent.

## Job listings review

The job listing is the first thing a candidate will see. It needs to be accurate, informative and to the point.

What are the elements of a job listing that will appeal to an engineer? How do we stand out from other job listings?

## Resume review

Evaluating a technical resume is difficult and time-consuming. Matt will work with you to identify promising candidates, to improve the conversion rate of your hiring funnel, and to keep hiring managers happy.
