After my recent move to NYC, I discovered that my Google Calendar was 3 hours off from my iPhone calendar. No worries, just go into the iPhone Settings — General — Date &amp; Time and make sure the phone understands the time zone. Huh, well, it’s set automatically, over the air.

There is a setting in Google Calendar for time zone. Changed that. No joy.

Finally, I looked deep into the iPhone’s Mail, Contacts and Calendar settings — and way at the bottom of that screen, you set the time zone for the _calendar_. And it wasn’t the same as the phone’s time zone. Sheesh. Now my calendars are synced up.
