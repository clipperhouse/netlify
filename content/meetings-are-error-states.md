Paul Graham explores the difference between [the maker’s schedule and the manager’s schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html). People that know me have heard me say that “meetings are the opposite of work”. Paul offers empathy:
When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. […]   

For someone on the maker’s schedule, having a meeting is like throwing an exception.

Indeed. The maker’s schedule and the manager’s schedule are also an example of the tension between [quality and certainty](/blog/post/Known-and-unknown-unknowns.aspx).
