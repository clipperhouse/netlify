title: "Tegra notebooks wanted"

I would love to see notebooks based on Nvidia’s insane Tegra chip:




The above can drive 720p HDMI output from a friggin’ handheld. The Zune HD uses one. So why not a notebook?

A friend recently got a [netbook](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002DYIXN2?tag=clipperhouse-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B002DYIXN2&amp;adid=03JGMB5SCVT918SJRNCR&amp;) as a gift, and it’s cool, and it gets like 10 hours of battery life, but it’s _way_ slow. Shouldn’t your notebook be as powerful as your handheld? Shouldn’t it run video without breaking a sweat, as the iPhone does?

Nvidia, not surprisingly, [wants the same thing](http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/mobile/display/20091215160722_Nvidia_Promises_Tegra_2_Based_Netbooks_Smartbooks_Smartphones_in_2010.html). I wonder what it would take for Microsoft to compile a version of Win 7 for Tegra/ARM.

I bet that ChromeOS will [support](http://armnews.wordpress.com/2009/09/25/tegra-and-chromeos/) these chips and we’ll see some bitchen stuff — like a cheap, fast tablet — in a year or so.
