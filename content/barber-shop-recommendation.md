_Tech blogging shall resume shortly._

So, it was 90+ degrees in NY and I went for a run. I’ve never perspired that much in my life. On the walk back to where I was staying, I stopped in a barber shop and said “how much to take it off”?

$16. Wow, that’s cheap. The place did a proper job and even shaved my neck with a straight blade.

They’re called [Reamir](http://www.reamir.com/) and apparently they have several locations in Manhattan. I was at the one on 57th and 2nd.

And they’re very nice, closer to a stylist than a barber shop. They’re Uzbeki. They give [free cuts to veterans](http://www.derringermedia.com/images/reamir/image16.pdf) [pdf] on Wednesdays. And apparently they hang out with [Gwyneth Paltrow](http://www.reamir.com/page_info.php?pages_id=1?osCsid=8f192ec393cd07ddee6f4f1f6a7c2250).
