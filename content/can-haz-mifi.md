This [portable 3G-to-Wifi hotspot](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-10247616-64.html) looks really great. Apparently Verizon and Sprint will offer it. The size is amazing — they claim it’s equivalent to “8 stacked credit cards”. (I am a bit shocked that no one has used the brand “MiFi” before!)

As with all things portable, battery life is the limiting factor. Only about 4 hours of active usage. A bit of [research](http://b2b.vzw.com/broadband/mobilehotspot.html) shows that you can power it from the wall or from your laptop USB to get a bit more time.

I am picturing this for offsite meetings and such. You’d have to be a road warrior to justify an extra $60 a month, so it’s a corporate play, imho. But you’d get some pretty serious nerd cred if you’re hanging at a conference or some such.

My birthday is in December. Just sayin’.
