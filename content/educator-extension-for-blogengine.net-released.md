title: "Educator extension for BlogEngine.net released"

I’ve created an extension for [BlogEngine.Net](http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/) to improve typography. It “educates” the text, so that quotes and apostrophes are transformed into their smart (curly) counterparts. This blog uses it.

It’s called Educator and details are [here](/BlogEngine/).
