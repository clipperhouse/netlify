A product process is typically something like Strategy → Discovery → Specification → Build → Delivery.

We on product teams understand most of these, but many companies struggle with “strategy”. It’s often mocked, and often with reason.

What is it _for_? What makes a good one?

### Actionable

A PM, a developer, or a designer reading a strategy should think “Yes! I know **what to do next**.” Product should fall out of a strategy naturally and quickly.

A key component of “actionable” is **persuasive**. Our colleagues are the first market test of a strategy; if they are not won over, we have work to do.

Where projects don’t support a strategy, we drop those projects. If this never happens, the strategy is underdefined.

### Accountable

A strategy **characterizes the bet** we wish to make. Is it a $10,000 bet, a $100,000 bet or a $1,000,000 bet? One month, three months or six months? What are the opportunity costs?

The strategy offers a clear picture of success, and a **time frame** by which it will be visible.

A good strategy is a **hypothesis**. Another word for “accountable” is **testable**.

We lose some bets; this is normal and good. We may decide to double down or to cut losses, and we do so crisply.

### Researched

A strategy is expected to do its homework. We **talk to users** and their proxies.

We engage with data scientists — not for the numbers, but for the epistemology. The data scientists I know are great at turning **philosophies into hypotheses**. They describe what is knowable, and what is not, and why that’s OK.

We characterize **uncertainty**. When we make assumptions, we label them as such, and we don’t mistake them for facts. We [understand Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference).
