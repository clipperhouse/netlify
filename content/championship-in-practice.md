This is a follow-on to my [introductory post on championship](/championship/), please give that a read for background.

So! Championship sounds nice, but how to put it into practice? Here's how we did it on the Talent team at Stack Overflow.

> This system developed as a collaboration between Product Managers Puneet Mulchandani & Des Darilek, and myself as Engineering Manager.

### Pre-sprint: pitching and socialization

In the days leading up to each sprint planning, product managers organize ideas that might be delivered in the upcoming sprint. Deliverables need not be implemented features; they can just as easily be specs, designs, or research.

Pitching and socialization are encouraged! Actually not just encouraged, but obligatory: managers champion projects in the hope that others will join. (Pro tip: projects that are clear are more likely to get a champion.)

This happens asynchronously, usually in the form of a Google Docs with open comments.

### Set up for crisp decisions

The Talent team keeps two main Trello boards, which we refer to as backstage and “the sprint board” (aka front stage).

The sprint board is also called “the reality board”. It strictly contains items that are being actively worked, to be delivered _this sprint_.

### The sprint

The team gathers synchronously (usually a Hangout) to champion projects for the next sprint. Candidate projects appear in a “Proposed” column in Trello, on the reality board.

To begin, each contributor reviews their current projects, to ensure that the board reflects reality. Then, we go through each proposed project, and ask who, if anyone, would like to champion it.

If we get one, great! Move the card to the right. In the absence of a clear champion, a proposed project returns to backstage.

### Hewing to reality

Choosing to champion a project is not solely about intentions: it necessarily includes making realistic promises.

While on one hand we are recruiting champions for new projects, on the other hand we emphasize the ability to deliver. If a contributor is overbooked, or a proposal is underspecified, we don’t want them to champion. Saying no is often the right thing.

### Right-sized sprints

Our team’s sprints are bi-monthly (approximately two weeks). We can reasonably predict outcomes on that time scale.

Furthermore, deferred projects don’t fall into a hole: when a project wasn’t championed on this sprint, we can easily re-propose it on the next one, which will arrive soon. This allows us to say no without being discouraged.

### How it turned out

It’s easy to assume that developers will only choose “sexy”, technically interesting projects. This rarely happened in my observation.

Rather, developers tend to choose projects that they agree are impactful for users, or for the business. The technical part was often uninteresting. From Puneet:

> “Team culture plays a huge role here, I think.

> In order for this to work smoothly, the team needs to be bought in on a common high-level goal or objective. 

> Without a common end-goal, it's hard to argue about what projects should be chosen. In our case at Stack when we put this into effect, we had an explicit push towards refocusing on the user, empathizing with them, and addressing their pain points however small they may be. 

> And, of course, a team that actually cares helps too :)”

This gets back to managers: when we do a good job championing projects, individual contributors will do the same.
