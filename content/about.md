I am a founder, engineering manager and developer in NYC. I recently decided to leave Stack Overflow, and am taking some time to find my next thing. I’d like to start something new or join something small.

For now, I am looking for interesting people to meet and collaborate with. Ideas:

- Data science, and NLP in particular. I see opportunities in extracting features from unstructured text. [Here’s one idea](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lqMYoLtqeu6q2Q_ToI_f5hHMV4tNULtgL9jVizhE7SA/edit?usp=sharing).
- Fixing niche problems with domain experts. There is a remarkable amount of friction/entropy within industries and across systems, that people will pay to fix.

### Engineering Manager

Most recently, I was Engineering Manager at Stack Overflow, overseeing the team building the Talent product. A few essays about management:

- [Championship](/championship/)
- [Bugs are a failure of prediction](/bugs-are-a-failure-of-prediction/)
- [The makings of a strategy](makings-of-a-strategy/)
- [Lore](/lore/)

### Developer

I like Go and C#, and high-performance web applications.

- I am working on a tokenizer and lemmatizer in Go, called [Jargon](/jargon/).
- I created a package for generics for Go, called [gen](/gen/overview/).
- I built [Stack Overflow tag correlations](/stack-correlations/).
- All of the engineering for [Alikewise](/alikewise/).
- A fun little [classical radio player](/classical/).
- And of course, a lot of the code in Stack Overflow Talent.

### Founder

I founded and led engineering for [Alikewise](/alikewise/), a dating site based on books.

### Explainer

Non-technical folks appreciate my ability to explain technology, and how to get things done with engineers. At Stack Overflow, this meant salespeople and technical recruiters.

I offer this expertise on a consulting basis, for your teams.
