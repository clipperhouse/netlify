### Hi, I’m Matt

I am a founder, engineering manager and developer in NYC. I recently decided to leave Stack Overflow, and am taking some time to find my next thing. I’d like to start something new or join something small.

For now, I am looking for interesting people to meet and collaborate with. Ideas:

- Data science, and NLP in particular. I see opportunities for turning unstructured text into humane applications.
- Fixing niche problems with domain experts. There is a remarkable amount of friction/entropy within industries and across systems, that people will pay to fix.

### Engineering Manager

Most recently, I was Engineering Manager at Stack Overflow, overseeing the team building the Talent product. I have a lot to say about building and managing product teams. Hiring and performance evaluation are specialties.

### Developer

I like Go and C#, and high-performance fast web applications. I am currently working on a tokenizer and lemmatizer in Go, called [Jargon](https://github.com/clipperhouse/jargon). I built [Stack Overflow tag correlations](/stack-correlations/).

### Explainer

Non-technical folks appreciate my ability to explain technology and how to get things done when working with engineers. At Stack Overflow, this meant working with salespeople and technical recruiters.

### Founder

I founded and led engineering for [Alikewise](/alikewise), a dating site based on books.

### Contact

I am on Twitter [@clipperhouse](https://mobile.twitter.com/@clipperhouse). Happy to chat.

I am also reachable at mwsherman@gmail.com and +1 415 516-5121.

Here’s [my LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/clipperhouse).
