### Hi, I'm Matt

I am an independent developer and engineering manager based in NYC. I decided to leave my very good job at Stack Overflow, and am looking for interesting projects.

### Engineering manager

Most recently, I was Engineer Manager at Stack Overflow, overseeing the team building the Talent product. I have a lot to say about engineering and product management, happy to chat.

### Developer

I like Go and C#, and have built some stuff.

I am currently working on a tokenizer and lemmatizer in Go, called [Jargon](https://github.com/clipperhouse/jargon).

I built a [Stack Overflow tag correlations](/stack-correlations/).

### Founder

I founded and did the engineering (and design direction) for Alikewise, a dating site based on books.

### Contact

I am on Twitter [@clipperhouse](https://mobile.twitter.com/@clipperhouse). Happy to chat.

I am also reachable at mwsherman@gmail.com and +1 415 516-5121.

Here's [my LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/clipperhouse).
