OK, so a friend is raving about his Droid phone, and it sounds quite cool. The Palm Pre has some good ideas too. Hopefully a little competition will keep Apple from being Apple — “we know what’s best for you” — too often.

So, a few things that would dramatically improve the email experience on the iPhone, for this humble user anyway.

*   **Unified email view:** Allow me to see all my email messages, from multiple accounts, in one list. The Blackberry does this, and they combine SMS into the same view while they’re at it.
*   **Status-at-a-glance:** How many _new_ email messages do you have? There is no way of knowing on the iPhone. I can see the count of _unread_ ones, but then I’d have to remember what that number was an hour ago to know if anything’s new. And please, [why must I log in](/blog/post/A-simple-way-that-Apple-can-improve-iPhone-battery-life-and-user-experience.aspx) to find this out?
*   **Email folder bookmarks:** I haven’t seen anyone suggest this yet. Allow me to place a bookmark directly into a specific mail folder or account, on my home screen. Update that icon with a badge indicating new/unread in that folder. This will dovetail very well with the filters I have set up in Gmail.
*   **Unified contacts:** The Palm Pre [does](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZboVu8Xa_0) this: it brings in pictures and other info from your Facebook, LinkedIn, etc and matches them with your contacts. A little [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/) integration might be clever, too.
