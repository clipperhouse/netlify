I am happy to announce that I’ve taken a job over at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

I’ve been a reader and admirer of [Joel](http://joelonsoftware.com) and [Jeff](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000679.html) for some years now, so I am thrilled to be working alongside them. (Hopefully they won’t catch on to the fact that I don’t write code, I merely copy-and-paste from Stack Overflow.)

In fact, I wasn’t really looking for a job, what with Alikewise and some freelance [gigs](http://www.flickr.com/photos/seeminglee/4648809754/) I’ve been doing. But upon hearing that they were [hiring](http://stackoverflow.com/about/hiring), I had to [put in a CV](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/) to see what would happen.

I am flattered by their interest, and hope to assist in their [goals](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/37328/my-godits-full-of-unicorns) of world domination do some great stuff.

I’ll reveal an unflattering truth: I kinda like thinking I am the smartest guy in the room. The time I’ve spent at S.O. so far has cured me of that fantasy. Wish me luck.
