Google’s search market share in Europe is [over 80%](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/18/the-web-in-charts—google-vs-microsoft-yahoo-vs-china/). Meanwhile, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer — the target of repeated anti-trust charges by the EU — [hovers under 50%](http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/03/firefox-3-marketshare-exceeds-internet-explorer-7-in-europe.ars) in Europe.

By [creating an operating system](/blog/post/Can-Google-Chrome-OS-get-traction.aspx), it seems that Google is doing what monopolists are prohibited from doing: extending its dominance from one market to another. (Of course, Google’s new OS doesn’t exist yet and won’t have substantial market share for several years.)

I wonder if Google’s entry into the new market will concern the EU regulators…?
