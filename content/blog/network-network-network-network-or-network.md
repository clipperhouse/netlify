I love how Vista offers me so many choices in getting on the interwebs. I can:

*   Connect to a **network**
*   Manage wireless **networks**
*   Set up a connection or **network**
*   Manage **network** connections

I can do this by first going to **Network** and Internet, and then to the **Network** and Sharing Center. So far, there are 6 “network” places that might do what I need. There’s also a **Network** item in the Start Menu which is something else. Oooh, I can also Add a device to the **network**, apparently a different task.

It’s kinda like having a whole staff of butlers waiting to serve my needs.

Right?
