So, in the Apple-Google-AT&amp;T kerfuffle over Google Voice being rejected from the iPhone, I [haven’t heard](/blog/post/A-market-opportunity-for-Verizon-and-Sprint.aspx) many reasons I consider viable. [This one is](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Mobile-and-Wireless/Apples-Rejection-of-Google-Voice-Points-to-Just-One-Thing-189443/):
I’ve been asking myself exactly why Apple or AT&amp;T would stir up the hornet’s nest to deny the technology and risk the ire of both the government and one of their most valuable partners, and also why each company’s stance is full of contradictory actions.After a little reflection, the answer became resoundingly clear: Apple is building a similar service to add to MobileMe.
