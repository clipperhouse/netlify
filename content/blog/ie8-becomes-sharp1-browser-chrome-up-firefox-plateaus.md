We have January browser numbers. Firstly, we note that Internet Explorer 8 is now the [most popular browser](http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=3&amp;qptimeframe=M&amp;qpsp=121&amp;qpnp=13), overtaking IE6.

“Modern browsers”, as [previously defined](/blog/post/Modern-browsers-nearly-doubled-in-2009-IE6-lost-38-of-its-users.aspx), are now around 60% of the market. Chrome (my fave) gained 0.57 percentage points, which represents a 12% gain in user base.

Firefox stayed approximately even, with a slight downward trend, for the second month in a row.

IE6’s trend of loss leveled off a little bit, to 0.92 percentage points, or 4% of its user base for the month. [Adrian Kingsley-Hughes](http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=7102&amp;tag=nl.e539) needs to educate himself as to [why people use old browsers](http://blog.digg.com/?p=878). “UPGRADE PEOPLE!!” is a swing and a miss.
