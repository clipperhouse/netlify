There have been some interesting posts lately [asking](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/12/what-does-programmer-productivity-look-like.html) the question, “if some programmers are 10 times as productive as others, why aren’t they paid 10 times as much?”. It’s a good question, though I don’t think the recent posts quite get to the heart of it.

Some have said that it’s a sociological thing — that we, as a culture, generally don’t accept great disparities in pay. Within a mediocre organization, that might be true. (James Kwak [hypothesizes](http://baselinescenario.com/2009/12/24/salespeople-and-programmers/) that the market price is set by these mediocre organizations.)

But **markets tend to clear**, which means that over time the value should accrue to the better performer. The 10x programmer at the mediocre company will have a great incentive to go out on her own; if her productivity allows her to take on 10 times as many clients, she will net 10x the pay.

The problem is that the original question is a fallacy. **We don’t know, _a priori_, who these 10x programmers are.** Simply asserting their existence, and then musing about their pay, puts the cart before the horse.

The 10x programmer doesn’t exist until they do. I agree with John Cook that [measuring productivity is hard](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/12/23/why-programmers-are-not-paid-in-proportion-to-their-productivity/), but we do have a way. Call it Sherman’s Fairly Obvious Productivity Test:
**If our newly-independent programmer does not make 10x the money, we must admit that she is not the 10x programmer we thought she was.**

The essence of my argument is this: “productivity” is a metric in a vacuum. It’s incomplete and unempirical. The definition of productivity must have a **relationship to the value of what is being produced**. And the only way to measure the value is market response.

This market response might be measured in money that accrues to the programmer; in the case of open source, it might be measured in the hard value derived by users of the software (e.g., the ROI of a company adopting Linux).

An expertly-prepared steak, served to a vegetarian, does not make one a great cook. Driving a Prius in the wrong direction is not fuel-efficient.

And so the ability to solve technical problems, with great wisdom and elegance, does not a “productive” programmer make. **The productive programmer must prove the ability to deliver things _of value to their customer_**, broadly defined. Anything short of this test is academic.

_PS. In fact, I do think these 10x programmers exist: they create startups with the windfalls that you hear about. They go by the names of Bill Gates, Linus Torvalds, Paul Graham, etc._
