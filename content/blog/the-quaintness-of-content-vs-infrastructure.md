Here’s a really informative article on the [economics of Google’s fiber offer](http://muninetworks.org/content/economics-google-gigabit). One of the key takeaways is that Google’s ownership of high-bandwidth content (YouTube) gives them leverage in peering arrangements.

There was a time when arguments about the net (neutrality in particular) hinged on a Luddish mental model that “content” and “infrastructure” were, and should be, different.
