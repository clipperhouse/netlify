title: "OCD is id, high standards are ego"

As programmers, we have a powerful tool that we deploy often: OCD.

While the name connotes a ‘disorder’, certain obsessive behaviors make for very effective programmers. Remember, code that is 99% right is wrong. Crashingly, money-losingly wrong. OCD is made for this profession.

Its strength, however, is also its weakness: it monopolizes our attention. Our ability to dive deep, to focus, to simply _not let things go_, makes for amazing code and terrible time management.

To me, this makes programmers something you don’t hear often: _visceral_. We think we do big-brain work; perhaps we do. But our decision of what to prioritize in this moment, and for the next several moments, is often pure _id_.

Herein lies the confusion: obsession as a proxy for high standards. The difference is that high standards are defined by what we deliver to others; OCD is not.

OCD is entirely about the self. It is an urge to be assuaged.

‘High standards’ (for lack of a better expression) are closer to ethics, or _ego_. They describe the desire to do the right thing _for others_, regardless of reward. It is outward where OCD is inward.

The distinction is not binary, to be sure. OCD can be a great tool to be deployed in the service of high standards.

Think of it this way: you’re swinging a hammer. Are you building a bench, or pounding a nail?
