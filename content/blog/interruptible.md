There are two categories of job in a startup: those where interruptibility is a feature, and those where it is a bug.

Developers and designers should be protected from interruption. They benefit from deep, long periods of thought, where a complex mental model can be built up in their head. Interruption hurts, viscerally.

(At Stack, we know this, which is why we so enthusiastically offer private offices and remote work to those roles.)

When I went from developer to manager, I learned that bit had flipped: it’s now part of my job to be interruptible.

Interruption becomes a feature, not a bug. Interrupting me becomes efficient for the organization, in that _their_ (developer’s, designer’s) time is [likely more valuable](https://clipperhouse.com/time-well-spent-d6c4c3bc7a27) than mine.

And beyond the merits, I like a person to feel that way.

### Purgatory

I feel sympathy for those where they are expected to be both interruptible, and not. Product Managers meet this definition.

On the one had, as a hub for so much decision-making, they need to be responsive. Interruptibility is a feature.

But! PMs are also expected to write specs, analyze data and work through competing priorities. Those things require sustained attention and (ding ding) to keep a lot in mind at once. Interruptibility is a bug.
