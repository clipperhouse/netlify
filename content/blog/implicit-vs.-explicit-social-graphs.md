There are two kinds of social graphs in the world, explicit and implicit. The explicit ones are the most rare and give their owners disproportionate market values.

The two I am thinking of are Facebook (private market value around $40B) and LinkedIn, with a public market cap of ~$6B. What makes their graphs explicit is that two individuals **deliberately and mutually describe** their connection with one another.

Implicit “soft” graphs include Twitter and Google (via Gmail). In Twitter’s case, the opt-in is only one way; only one user declares interest in another, and it need not be reciprocated. Gmail’s graph is inferred from your behavior — they know with whom you’ve interacted, but _you_ haven’t explicitly told Gmail about your relationship with a person.

Explicit graphs can be mined more easily, since they begin with hard data. As I’ve mentioned in the past, it’s [data, not algorithms](http://clipperhouse.com/2009/08/30/it%E2%80%99s-the-data-not-the-algorithm/) that will be hard for competitors to replicate in the future.

So, explicit graphs should be understood as truly personal, and _social_. Implicit graphs should be understood as a compilation of our interests.

Knowing _what_ we like is old science, going back to the advent of credit cards. _Who_ we like is new information. Thus the valuations.
