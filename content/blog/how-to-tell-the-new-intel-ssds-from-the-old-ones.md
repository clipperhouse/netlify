title: "How to tell the new Intel SSDs from the old ones"

Intel today announced [faster and cheaper](http://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2009/07/intels-new-34nm-ssds-cut-prices-by-60-percent-boost-speed.ars) versions of their very impressive solid state hard drives (SSDs). I didn’t see any ship dates so I guess they are making their way into the sales channel now.

Since the new ones and the old ones share the X25-M model name, you’ll want to know which one you are getting.

To get the new ones, you’ll want to look for a “G2” at the end of the model name. For example, the 2.5” 80GB new (34nm) version is SSDSA2MH080**G2**, whereas the previous (50nm) equivalent is SSDSA2MH080**G1**.
