A quick list of the things I use to improve my web experience:

[HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) – Does its best to detect whether a site offers HTTPS, and switches to that if so.

[DNSCrypt](http://www.opendns.com/about/innovations/dnscrypt/) – DNS traffic can be encrypted, too.

Block third-party cookies – In Chrome it’s a checkbox at chrome://settings/content. In Safari, it’s the default. [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) is a nice Safari wrapper, btw.

[AdBlock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/) – Ad blocker that’s open source. _Funny story: I work for a company that makes money on ads, and I wrote one of our ad servers. Every six months or so, I give myself a heart attack when I don’t see the ads on the site, and remember above._

I don’t hate ads by the way, just the 90[% of them](http://clipperhouse.com/2014/02/18/threshold-thinking/) that are worthless.

[Disconnect](https://disconnect.me/disconnect) – Blocking of analytics and such.

All of the above have the ability to cause trouble under certain conditions, but they work well for me. DNSCrypt takes a few seconds to get going on a new connection._Originally published at_ [_clipperhouse.com_](http://clipperhouse.com/2014/09/06/my-security-and-privacy-tools/) _on September 6, 2014._
