			<h1>Interruptible</h1>
			<div>
				<p>There are two categories of job in a startup: those where interruptibility is a feature, and those where it is a bug.</p>
<p>Developers and designers should be protected from interruption. They benefit from deep, long periods of thought, where a complex mental model can be built up in their head. Interruption hurts, viscerally.</p>
<p>(At Stack, we know this, which is why we so enthusiastically offer private offices and remote work to those roles.)</p>
<p>When I went from developer to manager, I learned that bit had flipped: it’s now part of my job to be interruptible.</p>
<p>Interruption becomes a feature, not a bug. Interrupting me becomes efficient for the organization, in that <em>their</em> (developer’s, designer’s) time is <a href="https://clipperhouse.com/time-well-spent-d6c4c3bc7a27">likely more valuable</a> than mine.</p>
<p>And beyond the merits, I like a person to feel that way.</p>
<h3 id="purgatory">Purgatory</h3>
<p>I feel sympathy for those where they are expected to be both interruptible, and not. Product Managers meet this definition.</p>
<p>On the one had, as a hub for so much decision-making, they need to be responsive. Interruptibility is a feature.</p>
<p>But! PMs are also expected to write specs, analyze data and work through competing priorities. Those things require sustained attention and (ding ding) to keep a lot in mind at once. Interruptibility is a bug.</p>
