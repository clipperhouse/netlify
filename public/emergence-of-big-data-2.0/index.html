			<h1>The emergence of Big Data (2.0)</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I’ve written previously on the idea that <a href="http://clipperhouse.com/blog/post/Ite28099s-the-data-not-the-algorithm.aspx">data, not algorithms</a>, will be a main differentiator for web companies moving forward. What does this mean?</p>
<p>In short, it’s not hard to hire very smart people to write algorithms. One or two PhD’s can produce a lot of great logic. But algorithms need data — big data — to be useful, and that’s considerably harder to amass. Only a small number of firms will have it, and it will represent a barrier to entry that nimble startups can’t climb.</p>
<p>So I was intrigued to learn that Google recently <a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2009/10/29/google-redefines-disruption-the-%E2%80%9Cless-than-free%E2%80%9D-business-model/">dropped both of its map data providers</a>. Apparently, Google has been able to build its own database, based on its own data collection and public sources. Combine this development with Google’s <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/28/google-adds-free-turn-by-turn-navigation-car-dock-ui-to-android/">entry</a> into the turn-by-turn mapping business, and I see 3, 4, maybe 5 firms being kneecapped.</p>
<p>(Google doesn’t entirely confirm my premise about data vs algorithms: they have both. Why choose?)</p>
<p>I also learned recently that Amazon’s book database is <a href="http://oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html?page=3">becoming</a> the canonical bibliographic data source — possibly eclipsing an incumbent provider called RR Bowker. Amazon might also be the best data source of “what people buy”.</p>
<p>Going further, Facebook is becoming <em>the</em> source for “who people know” while Twitter defines “what people are talking about”.</p>
<p>These companies therefore represent the advent of Big Data 2.0. (The 1.0 version was the unsexy B2B brands — like RR Bowker — that didn’t make the leap to consumers.)</p>
<p>If you need to understand why these firms do what they do as they fight it out, ask yourself what data they are trying to own.</p>
