<div class="post-content">
  <p>This is an <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57594171-38/google-tests-encryption-to-protect-users-drive-files-against-government-demands/">encouraging story</a> about Google exploring the ability to encrypt ‘sitting files’ in their Google Drive product. This is distinct from something like SSL, which only protects items in transit; most companies store the canonical file in the clear.</p>

<p>Declan mentions problem #1, which is that encrypted files are hard to search, and search is Google’s thing. Take that away, and the product is devalued.</p>

<p>What is less thoroughly explored is that, for the government to actually be impeded in retrieving your files, Google would have to be <strong>legitimately ignorant of your key</strong>. Which means that you would have to be the unique owner of said secret.</p>

<p>In this scenario, Google could not be compelled, secretly, to hand over your files, because they do not have the technical ability to do so.</p>

<p>(Remember, this is not true if Google encrypts your files but also holds the key.)</p>

<p>If the gov’t wanted access to your files, they’d have to compel you to hand over the key — and this sort of pursuit would be harder to keep on the DL. It also wouldn’t scale (a feature, not a bug).</p>

<p>We might call this the incidence of compulsion, where ‘incidence’ is used the sense of tax incidence.</p>

<p>We have well-known statutes and procedures about compelling information from individuals. Our procedures for compelling information from organizations, however, are largely opaque and legally immature.</p>

<p>So, from a privacy perspective, you would rather the law ask <em>you</em> for information, transparently, rather than asking an organization for same, secretly.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Back to the product problem: users expect to be able to get in touch with a vendor should they lose their password. In the above scenario, loss of the key would mean loss of the files; Google simply couldn’t help you, for the same reason they couldn’t help the gov’t.</p>

<p>And this is a devalued product for a lot of users. So I wonder how much Google stands to gain from such a thing.</p>
