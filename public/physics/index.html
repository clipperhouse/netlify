			<h1>80% of physics in 800 words</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I had a physics professor who said the most important skill in science was to be able to characterize a system approximately and quickly. Be approximately right instead of precisely wrong. This has stuck with me.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s physics for non-scientists, who wish to be approximately right.</p>
<h3 id="heat">Heat</h3>
<p>Hot things want to cool off. Cold things want to warm up. The hotter a thing is, the faster it will cool off.</p>
<p>Temperature <em>difference</em> is what matters, and is what you feel. When something feels cool, it&rsquo;s because your body heat is leaving your body and warming up the thing. If something feels neither hot nor cold, it&rsquo;s because you and it are the same temperature.</p>
<p>Nature doesn&rsquo;t like differences, and will try to reduce them. Our senses are sensitive to differences.</p>
<h3 id="light">Light</h3>
<p>X-rays, Wi-fi, radio broadcasts and sunlight are all physically the same thing. We give them different names becuase we use them differently.</p>
<p>They differ in their <em>frequency</em>. They are vibrations. The frequency is how fast they vibrate. Think about ripples in a pond, or a guitar string.</p>
<p>Those vibrations might hit other things. The effect might be to warm up your skin, or to illuminate a room, or to cast a shadow.</p>
<p>Those vibrations might pass <em>through</em> other things, or bounce off of them.</p>
<p>The higher-frequency vibrations are more intense, but they are also easier to block. Blue has a higher frequency than red. A sunset might look red because the blue light has been blocked by the air.</p>
<p>Human eyes can see a small range of frequencies, represented by the rainbow, which we unsurprisingly call &ldquo;visible light&rdquo;. We can&rsquo;t see Wi-fi or X-rays.</p>
<p>Most light is a combination of many frequencies. Combining lots of frequencies makes light look whiter.</p>
<p>Ultra-violet (UV) light has a high frequency, and is just barely outside what our eyes can see. Sunscreen mostly blocks it, as does glass.</p>
<p>Infra-red light, which has a low frequency, is also just barley outside what we can see.</p>
<h3 id="heat-and-light">Heat and light</h3>
<p>Everything that is warm is also radiating light. We mostly don&rsquo;t see it, it&rsquo;s infra-red.</p>
<p>If something is warm enough, we can see the light. We call that &ldquo;red hot&rdquo;. Even hotter things can be &ldquo;blue hot&rdquo; or &ldquo;white hot&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="sound">Sound</h3>
<p>Sound is a vibration of air. Again, think ripples in a pond.</p>
<p>High-frequency sound is called &ldquo;treble&rdquo;, low-frequency sound is call &ldquo;bass&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As with light, higher sound frequencies are easier to block. When your neighbor is playing music, you will mostly hear the bass, because the walls have blocked the treble.</p>
<p>Trebly things are easier for us to locate with our ears. It&rsquo;s harder to figure out where bassy things are coming from.</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Your location is where you are. If your location is changing, we call that speed. If your speed is changing, we call that acceleration.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t feel speed. You can feel acceleration. You get pulled back into your seat during take off, but not when you are cruising.</p>
<p>There is the thing, a change in the thing, and a change in a change in a thing.</p>
<p>Money is similar! Our wealth is what we have. If our wealth is changing, we call that income (or spending). If our income is changing, we call that a raise (or inflation).</p>
<p>Calculus is the math that helps us to understand changes of changes.</p>
<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>
<p>If one thing is moving faster than another thing, and they collide, the fast thing will make the slow thing move faster, and vice-versa. Think about billiard balls.</p>
<p>Nature doesn&rsquo;t like differences! The greater the <em>difference</em> in speed, the more violent the collision will be.</p>
<p>This happens with air, and with water, too. Your car is hitting millions of air molecules, causing those molecules to go faster, while those molecules cause your car to go slower.</p>
<p>We call this air resistance, or friction. We usually want less of it. Car manufacturers design the shape of their cars so that they will hit less air.</p>
<p>Sometimes we want more friction. Think about the soles of your snow boots.</p>
<p>Friction causes thing to become hotter. Speed gets turned into heat. Usually, it&rsquo;s not much heat, and we don&rsquo;t notice it. Things that fall from space, like meteors and Space Shuttles, definitely do feel the heat.</p>
