		<h2>For want of parens in Ruby</h2>
		<p>
			Ruby is beautiful in many ways. The opportunities to create tight, readable code are impressive. More than other languages, it affords the opportunity to make code look like what it does.

		<h2>Fasctimidating</h2>
		<p>
			Chris Baus laments that developers are rarely impressed by other developers. It’s often true. But why are developers hard to (outwardly) impress?

		<h2>Alerts as spam</h2>

		<h2>What if ‘source code’ were a serialized syntax tree?</h2>
		<p>
			At the risk of revealing my lack of a CompSci degree: what if ‘source code’ were replaced by serialized syntax trees?

		<h2>Debugging is debugging</h2>
		<p>
			I use CoffeeScript here and there. And JavaScript everywhere else.
Depending on the scenario, and this is a matter of taste, CoffeeScript is more elegant, readable, and usable.

		<h2>Your phone is faster than Amtrak’s wifi</h2>
		<p>
			Amtrak is improving its wifi, it claims. Fine. The problem is, it’ll never be faster than your phone’s 4G connection.

	<a href="https://clipperhouse.com/ad-blocking-like-piracy-is-a-market-phenomenon/">
		<h2>Ad blocking, like piracy, is a market phenomenon</h2>
