    <h2 class="post-title">Web Components: have we not been here before?</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Addy Osmani describes Web Components, of which an important part is custom tags. The promise: In one word, a future with Web Components is declarative. JavaScript still exists in this future, but is relegated back to a role where it acts as a glue holding the other bits of a component together. Web Apps in the near future will be composed almost entirely from elements (tags). Some of these elements (like the &lt;audio&gt; tag) will be given to you by the browser but others like &lt;slide-show&gt; will be custom elements provided by UI libraries or you can write it yourself....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">There are stylistic debates about how much nesting or indentation one should choose in code. This slide and the one that follows illustrate the issue well. The slide refers to “cognitive load” without explaining, and it occurs to me that nesting is state.
In the first example, if we want to debug around the highlighted line, what do we need to keep in mind? func (g *Gopher) WriteTo(w io.Writer) (size int64, err error) { err = binary....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I am really, really enjoying Ben Horowitz’s The Hard Thing About Hard Things. It’s blunt and refreshing, and lives up to its title. It’s a nice counter to the notion that running a business is dreamy and life-affirming all the time.
But! I was a bit surprised to find him advocate the sort of behavior that has ensnared a bunch of tech firms in a wage-fixing suit. A good rule of thumb is my Reflexive Principle of Employee Raiding, which states, “If you would be shocked and horrified if Company X hired several of your employees, then you should not hire any of theirs....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I’ve been working at Stack for over three years now, and over the last six months or so I’ve been doing playing with a programming language called Go. Both are highly regarded and, for many, controversial, and I’ve realized what they have in common.
Stack Overflow and Go are both optimized for artifacts. Which is to say, their goal is to create good outcomes that last a long time. Note that this is not the same as optimizing for the pleasure of their users....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I had a realization some years ago in working with a person at a previous firm. After many interactions, I noticed that my productivity, my happiness, my motivation consistently were diminished after dealing with them.
I found that I came out of these conversations feeling more burdened than I had going in.
I noticed with certain other people, our conversations were the opposite — I came away with fewer problems, or a new perspective, or food for thought, or feeling freshly challenged....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Threshold thinking</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I consider our industry’s current approach to ads to be wildly inefficient. Very “good” click-through rates are in the single-digit percentages, and more likely one or two orders of magnitude below that.
Let’s assume for the sake of argument that some brand advertising is valuable, which is to say that the impression serves a purpose even if the user doesn’t click.
So, being charitable, 90% of ads that we put on our sites are of no economic value, which is to say, of no value to the user....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">The trouble with interfaces in Go</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I am working on a tool for generics-like functionality in Go. Despite what you may have heard, Go does have generic functionality, in that you can create (e.g.) methods which operate on any type, by using interface{} — the interface that all types implement. For example, you can do something like:
func DoSomething(interface{}) interface{} {
…
}
…where both the input parameter and the output return value are interface{}. It’s quite flexible....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I’ve a new release of gen, the generics-like tool for Go. It includes API changes so I suggest reading the changelog. Highlights:
Markup instead of command-line Where before you would specify types to gen at the command line, à la gen package.Type, now you simply add tags to types (in comments):
// &#43;gen
type MyType struct {…}
…and the command-line simply becomes gen. This make re-generating easy, the specs are entirely in your code....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I previously mentioned that advertising-based publishers should embrace SSL as a product upgrade, a service to their customer. Here’s a more self-interested take.
When a user clicks is on a HTTPS site (such as Google, Hacker News, Twitter*…) and the link to which they navigate is plain HTTP, the referrer header will not be included with the request. So a publisher that receives incoming traffic from such a site will be blind in terms or referrers....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Here’s a good article about why news sites on the web are slow to embrace SSL. The short answer is, the advertising services they use are not prepared to support it.
This seems like an opportunity for publishers. How about this: make SSL available now, and turn off ads until the technical issues are settled. That’s right.
Firstly, it sends a pro-consumer message: “we’ve upgraded our site at no charge to you”....</p>
