		<h2>Three outcomes of the adpocalypse</h2>
		<p>
			It appears that Internet advertising is going through a bit of a shakeout. Ad blocking is becoming more pervasive (perhaps 30% of users), and a study by Google indicates that as many as 50% of ad “impressions” are never actually put in front of a human being.

		<h2>Statements are statements, and expressions are expressions (in Go)</h2>
		<p>
			I got trolled by a facetious article on Go on April 1. But it did trigger a conversation about why Go doesn’t do certain things other languages do.

		<h2>The legacy ad industry is wrong about ad blockers</h2>
		<p>
			I was recently directed to a couple of papers on browser ad-blocking software (here and here). They are not so much alarmist as they are self-serving and hindered by status quo bias.

		<h2>Embedding a struct declaration in a text template in Go</h2>
		<p>

		<h2>Yes, net neutrality is conservative. That’s the problem.</h2>
