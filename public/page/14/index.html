  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Today, Google announced that it will begin phasing out support on older browsers, most notably IE6, for Google Docs. It will take this step with Gmail and Calendar later in the year. This is a big step.
There has been much debate about the best way to handle browser obsolescence. On the one had, newer browsers offer a great improvement in user experience and web application capabilities. On the other hand, many people continue to use old browsers, largely because they don’t have other options....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I like the concept of e-books, if not their current state-of-the-art. The Kindle device sounds very impressive, I’ve only played with them a bit, and I know they have a lot of devoted fans.
One thing that gets underplayed is that “Kindle” is not simply a device, it’s Amazon’s e-book platform. So instead of spending $300 on the device, I am using the free Kindle for PC application. (There is also an iPhone version but jeez, that’s pushing it in terms of readability....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">So, I’ve been going a little Ajax crazy lately. I am using a progressive enhancement approach — make everything work solidly without Javascript, then drizzle on some Ajaxy goodness as refinement.
One problem is, on an Ajax-driven page, your user “loses” the use of the back button. It’s caused a mismatch between what the user and the browser consider to be a “new page”.
You’ll note that in your Ajax page, when the user clicks to a new “page state”, the URL doesn’t change....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I did a little test. I am using jQuery UI’s dialog, and setting it to be draggable. Pretty standard stuff — after all, dragging windows around your computer is commonplace.
A quick look into task manager and I see that dragging that modal around spikes the CPU to around 50%! (And this is with Chrome, an exceptionally fast browser.) Doing the same with a simple Windows file window pushes the CPU to only 10%....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">It appears that the hack against Google was perpetrated via their law enforcement compliance system. As an eminent group of security experts argued in 2008, the trend toward building surveillance capability into telecommunications architecture amounts to a breach-by-design, and a serious security risk. As the volume of requests from law enforcement at all levels grows, the compliance burdens on telcoms grow also — making it increasingly tempting to create automated portals to permit access to user information with minimal human intervention....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Hat tip to Sarah Lacy for laying it out so well: Google is ready to burn bridges. This is not how negotiations are done in China, and Google has done well enough there to know that. You don’t get results by pressuring the government in a public, English-language blog post. If Google were indeed still working with the government this letter would not have been posted because it has likely slammed every door shut […] This was a scorched earth move, aimed at buying Google some good will in the rest of the world; Chinese customers and staff were essentially just thrown under the bus....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">It would appear that Google is learning something about customer service: Google is selling the phone directly to end-users. That means many users are turning to it first, and the search giant doesn’t have the kind of customer support that mobile-phone users are accustomed to.[…] Another [customer] using the name SouthFlGuy was also sent back and forth between HTC and T-Mobile after finding no help from Google. “I guess I was under the wrong impression but I thought Google would handle the service on the phone,” he wrote....</p>

While not exactly house arrest, being on the no-fly list would be enough to severely diminish a person’s economic prospects and quality of life....</p>

The year If we consider “modern browsers” to be IE8, Firefox (all versions), Safari (all) and Chrome (all) and Opera (throw ’em a bone), then overall in 2009, the market share for modern browsers increased from 29.5% to 57.0% — nearly double. This is great news: a real majority of web users are now using very capable browsers....</p>
