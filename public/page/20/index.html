		<h2>Unsolicited iPhone suggestions #1: email</h2>
		<p>
			OK, so a friend is raving about his Droid phone, and it sounds quite cool. The Palm Pre has some good ideas too. Hopefully a little competition will keep Apple from being Apple — “we know what’s best for you” — too often.

		<h2>The emergence of Big Data (2.0)</h2>

			I’ve written previously on the idea that data, not algorithms, will be a main differentiator for web companies moving forward. What does this mean?

		<h2>Teevee on the peecee</h2>
		<p>
			So I’ve moved to a new place in NYC, and it’s a bit…cozier…than what I was used to in San Francisco. So I am looking for ways to save space and for now I’ve decided to go without a TV.

		<h2>Google Closure based on naive server-side notions?</h2>
		<p>
			I rely on libraries (mostly jQuery) instead of writing a lot of serious JavaScript these days. I mean, of course I am writing JavaScript but the libraries allow me to stay in “script space” — small procedure bits that are scripts as opposed to applications.

		<h2>Google music previews songs based on lyrics</h2>
		<p>
			Neat, if you type in a partial lyric to a song — without even referring to the title or artist — Google finds it and gives it to you to play right there.

		<h2>Windows virtual machines get competitive</h2>
		<p>
			Rackspace has announced that they are getting into the Windows virtual machine bizness. I’ve been waiting for this market to heat up, and have competition drive down some prices.

		<h2>A new language from Google</h2>
		<p>
			Neat, Google has a new language called Go. Clever branding, that.
It seems to be Google’s attempt to step into the Java/C# space. Perhaps I don’t know enough about languages to make such an assertion, but the thing that clued me in was its type safety. That seems decidedly untrendy.

		<h2>The Paris Hilton problem</h2>
		<p>
			Joel Spolsky has an article in Inc describing the tension between growth and quality at his company. The issue is, if your competitor is outgrowing you, their dominance might become self-fulfilling: customers prefer a safe choice, and the safe choice is what other customers are buying. Even if your product is better, nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd.

		<h2>The flagship strategy of mobile phones — Microsoft needs one</h2>
		<p>
			The flagship strategy of mobile phones — Microsoft needs one In the wake of the iPhone over the last few years, it seems that the market is responding to a business model different than the PC’s that preceded it. Mobile phones seem to require a very tight integration of hardware and software (and arguably service) to make a splash.

		<h2>Why is Apple treading water with the Apple TV? Because the real product is in the works.</h2>
		<p>
			Apple has come out with version 3.0 of its Apple TV product, and it appears to be little more than a visual refresh with a couple of nice bits of iTunes integration. It still doesn’t do what we expect of a “set-top box” or “media center”: things like recording live TV.
