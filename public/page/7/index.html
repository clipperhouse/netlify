		<h2>Publishers and SSL</h2>
		<p>
			Here’s a good article about why news sites on the web are slow to embrace SSL. The short answer is, the advertising services they use are not prepared to support it.

		<h2>Multi-credentialing</h2>
		<p>
			John Maeda of RISD has a riff about the future of college credentials, including the notion of an automated ‘degree’, which is generated by a machine based on the sum your achievements. He makes an analogy to Coinstar: pour in a bunch of individually valuable stuff, get out some paper which aggregates its value.

		<h2>Progress bars cannot be accurate</h2>
		<p>
			We all see progress bars and some of us even implement them. And we’ve all seen how hilariously wrong they can be. There’s a reason for that.

		<h2>Your site doesn’t need a novel progress indicator</h2>
		<p>
			There’s been healthy talk about progress indicators in the age of ajax. In our will-to-design I think some things are being missed.

		<h2>1.6% of what?</h2>
		<p>
			The NSA has published a paper claiming that it “touches” only 1.6% of Internet traffic. Now, 1.6% of something the size of the Internet is already enormous, but let’s demonstrate that the number represents are much larger share of human communications than one might intuit.

		<h2>Incidence of compulsion</h2>
		<p>
			This is an encouraging story about Google exploring the ability to encrypt ‘sitting files’ in their Google Drive product. This is distinct from something like SSL, which only protects items in transit; most companies store the canonical file in the clear.

		<h2>Epistemology and human factors: deal with ‘em</h2>

		<h2>A few thoughts on flat</h2>
		<p>
			I played with iOS7 today for a bit and discussed the flat design with a couple of Stack’ers. I also read Matt Gemmell’s review, and John Gruber’s take on flatness.
