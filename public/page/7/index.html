    <h2 class="post-title">The good might be the enemy of the perfect with software patents</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I have a few concerns, relating to unintended consequences, with a proposed loser-pays bill on software patents.
I quite like the idea of loser-pays, and it is the standard in many parts of the world. And I certainly don’t like the current state of affairs with software patents. But the intended narrowness of the bill may make things worse.
Firstly, it attempts to define a software patent as anything that might be implemented on a computer....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I am very interested in Windows 8 both as a user and as a tech industry watcher. Big bet, big changes.
Given the size of the bet, I believe Microsoft is making two UI mistakes that will cost them billions if they are released.
It took me, a developer and lifelong Windows user, quite a while to figure out how to search from the start screen. There is no search box....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">The new Retina Macbook looks quite beautiful, but from a productivity standpoint I am a bit disappointed. While they have quadrupled the pixel count (to 2880 x 1800), they have not increased real estate, per se.
In other words, the number of windows or characters or columns displayable on the screen has not changed — it is essentially a 1440 x 900 pixel display with increased sharpness. It’s like a new printer with a higher dpi, but the same paper size....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">At my ripe old age one might expect me to give up programming and focus more on management. Which I do, if informally. But I have never seen the need to put aside programming in order to manage.
Good programmers inevitably end up promoted into a management role. It’s a hard role: the demands on one’s time, and the sources of one’s satisfaction, change dramatically.
Too often, this means that one no longer writes production code....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Tim Lee offers two views of the economic case for innovation. I am certainly more Hayekian — I think expertise and information is inherently dispersed and the Hayekian view is more granular, if you will. It’s more likely to discover and serve niches and inefficiencies.
I think Tim hits the nail on the head that: Building an iPad didn’t just require millions of dollars, it required that those millions be spent by the right company....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Conservative and liberal</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">The ideas of conservative and liberal have become very confused, and in many cases exactly backwards. Let’s try to understand them — as adjectives instead of nouns — and strip them of some connotations.
A conservative idea is one that sees value in limiting change. The assumption is that an organic system is a long accretion of wisdom or value, and should not be changed lightly. The built-up information in the system might not be obvious, and so changing it risks a greater loss than one anticipates....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">It occurs to me, as I look at my Google&#43; stream for the first time in two months, the reason I never use it: it never had a chance to grow on me.
It’s beautifully implemented. It fills in niches that other platforms miss. It’s not an imitation of Facebook or Twitter (though it is obviously a reaction to those things).
No, the problem is that it is inorganic. It revealed itself to the world fully formed....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Consider for a moment the logic of the leading paragraph of this article: Research suggests that consumers spend only about one second looking at nutrition information when making myriad choices. A parent dashing through the grocery store aisles with kids in tow has to decide, in that one second, which is better: Triscuit vs. Saltines vs. Wheat Thins vs. Ritz? This is why Americans need a simple, standardized and truthful label on the front of all packaged foods....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">While “truthy” values in JavaScript can cause no small amount of heartache, one must admit they help readability. For objects anyway, it’s very nice to say if (object) {…} and get on with business. If the object is null or undefined, “false” strikes me as a perfectly legitimate behavior in that context.
I’d love to see something similar in C# — not truthiness, but an implicit test for existence.
Every object in C# has a ToString method....</p>
