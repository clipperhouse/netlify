  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp. — Greenspun
I am reminded of this quote when I see a common pattern in data stores, especially RDBMS. It’s a key-value pattern, along the lines of: Columns: IDType | ID | Value
…combined with application code which branches on the IDType column. The Value (and heck, the identifier) are interpreted differently based on the type....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Prompted by this question I got to thinking about methods in C# and Go. It’s another example, I realized, of Go’s (logical) insistence on orthogonality and (stylistic) insistence on flatness/lack of hierarchy.
Go does not allow methods to be defined within a struct (ersatz class) definition. Instead of this, where the method lives in the declaration: type Foo struct { Count, Price int Total() int { // nope return Count * Price } }...</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I was directed to a thread about a poor soul who started a project in Go, eventually had to hand it off to the community, and discovered that his original source no longer compiled, due to third-party dependencies having changed. Key quote: Not even the original programmer, with the original files on his original dev machine, can compile the source anymore.
I feel for the guy. Unfortunately, the above quote is not correct....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Here’s a smart and funny bit about culture fit. I think it’s brutal and by and large true. [1]
When I first heard the term “culture fit”, I thought intuitively, yes. Great way to build a company. Companies are cultures and we should aim to build them.
Then, not long after, I thought, wait. “Culture fit” among highly-educated-20-something-males-on-the-spectrum might not actually make for a great culture, if it’s going to be of any size....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Megan McArdle describes the understandable discomfort that some tenants and property owners have about Airbnb’ers coming into their buildings.
Airbnb will naturally drive up rents in places where it’s being used. If a tenant has the capacity to pay (e.g.) $2000 for an apartment, but can get an additional (e.g.) $300 a month, the tenant’s capacity to pay is now $2300.
A savvy landlord or condo association would want to capture this....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Another in a series of posts wherein I spitball about things that computer scientists already know, but have only just occurred to me.
Browsing the new Swift docs reveals that immutability is given pretty high billing. There are two keywords for variable declaration/assignment: let and var.
The former declares an immutable value; the latter a mutable one. The former is used much more often in the examples, providing a hint about the intentions of the designers....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">With the hubbub about net neutrality, fast lanes and Netflix, I though I would illustrate what we are dealing with technologically.
Netflix’s deal with Comcast is called “interconnect” or “peering”. It’s part of the wholesale, or B2B, side of the Internet.
Traditionally, Netflix would buy “transit” from a third-party like Cogent. Cogent, in turn, would make a deal with consumer ISPs such as Comcast, Verizon, Time Warner, et al, and thereby deliver Netflix’s bits to consumers....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">There is a notion I hear from time to time that earning (say) $100,000 while living in NYC makes one “middle class”. The logic being, NYC is expensive and $100K doesn’t go as far as it would in other places. Or, that many nearby people earn similar or higher incomes, putting one “in the middle”.
The facts are correct but the logic is exactly backwards. One lives in NYC because one has the means to do so....</p>

 added to a reading list delivered to my device(s) reformatted for readability (the main content is extracted and the page noise is stripped away)  You can see that there are 3 distinct use cases here, which happen to work well together....</p>
