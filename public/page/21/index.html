		<h2>Will Apple fix Boot Camp for Windows?</h2>
		<p>
			I wrote earlier about how Windows running on Mac hardware via Boot Camp appears to have serious battery-life issues — getting only around 2 hours of life on a machine that should offer at least twice that.

		<h2>Is Verizon’s network better, or is it simply untested?</h2>

			This article over a TechCrunch is putatively about the iPhone, but the take-away for me is that AT&amp;T’s data traffic has grown 50-fold over the last 3 years:

		<h2>Mozilla VP: “mistakes were made”</h2>
		<p>
			I love the language of Mozilla VP Mike Shaver’s non-retraction retraction regarding a Microsoft plugin for Firefox: We received confirmation from Microsoft this evening that the Framework Assistant add-on is not a mechanism for exploiting the vulnerabilities detailed in the earlier post, so we’ve removed it from the blocklist.

		<h2>Word nerdism #1: Make mine a medium</h2>
		<p>
			I am a word nerd, I love crosswords and love to wonder how words and expressions come to be. I also love thinking about computer languages as languages, with style and grammar. (For example, see the interplay between terseness and readability.)

		<h2>StackOverflow == Facebook * .0001</h2>
		<p>
			Apparently, Facebook is running around 30,000 physical servers. That hurts my head. With 300,000,000 users, that translates to around 10,000 users per server. They are doing (back-of-the-envelope) ~4.2 billion pageviews/day. Each server, then, is doing around 140,000 page views per day.

		<h2>Solving the n&#43;1 problem in Linq to SQL, using projection</h2>
		<p>
			Rick Strahl has a nice solution for mitigating the n&#43;1 problem in Linq to SQL. The n&#43;1 problem is a situation where, as you iterate over a set of query results in a list view, one or more additional database queries are fired for each row in the list. Since database calls are relatively expensive, you want to keep these to a minimum.

		<h2>When Apple aligns with a carrier, act II</h2>
		<p>
			Apple is not really a partnering company. They make their own hardware and software — and services like .Mac Mobile Me — to ensure a certain user experience. This is their offer, and it works.

		<h2>A thought experiment: serial vs parallel</h2>
		<p>
			Now that solid-state drives are arriving in the mainstream, I’ve been thinking about the implications of serial vs parallel and how they affect overall perceived performance. And by “perceived” I mean, what does the client — both the technical and human variety — experience?
