		<h2>Google as censor? Of course.</h2>
		<p>
			Daniel Indiviglio semi-condemns Google for its compliance with Chinese censorship laws. The “condemnation” is that they put profits before ethics. But that’s way too simplistic and strikes me as a bit insincere — as if we are shocked that Google is trying to make money.

		<h2>“Built-in” jQuery (and how IE can get some dev cred)</h2>
		<p>
			I’ve mentioned in the past that jQuery is an API as much as it is a set of functions. As syntaxes go, it’s very nice — consistent, logical, readable.

		<h2>What is a “programmer”?</h2>
		<p>
			Phil Haack has a nice exploration of what it means to “program”. As long as I’ve been doing this — since the early 90’s — there has always been the promise that “programming” will go away. This usually takes the form of visual tools that offer the ability to drag-and-drop the logical chunks of your programs together.

		<h2>64-bitness: what it is and what it ain’t</h2>
		<p>
			Very interesting post from Rico Mariani on the why’s and why-not’s of doing 64-bit applications, specifically Visual Studio. It’s important to understand that Visual Studio is about manipulating code, not the data that your code will ultimately handle.

		<h2>The cloud! The cloud!</h2>
		<p>
			Everything in technology is an abstraction of something else. The browser is an abstraction, the keyboard is an abstraction, C# is an abstraction; they all sit on top of other things and hide the details, with the goal of making you productive. (And each of those layers is actually comprised of many substrata.)

		<h2>More jQuery performance tips: 11 keystrokes buy you 10x</h2>
		<p>
			Dave Ward has a very extensive post (with benchmarks) on jQuery selector optimization. Really interesting stuff — the lesson is, the more specific your query, the faster it executes. The DOM is a data source, after all. He was able to achieve a 10x performance improvement by adding just 11 characters.
