  This portable 3G-to-Wifi hotspot looks really great. Apparently Verizon and Sprint will offer it. The size is amazing — they claim it’s equivalent to “8 stacked credit cards”. (I am a bit shocked that no one has used the brand “MiFi” before!)
As with all things portable, battery life is the limiting factor. Only about 4 hours of active usage. A bit of research shows that you can power it from the wall or from your laptop USB to get a bit more time.

  There’s a new build of my ASP.net jQuery Controls, adding the ability to use server-side control ID’s in selectors. Download is here, version history is here. Gimme feedback here.

  John Resig (jQuery guy) talks about advances in the next rev of Javascript (properly known as ECMAScript 5). It now has a “strict” mode, which makes Javascript look a lot more like a compiled language.
When I first moved from classic ASP — interpreted VBScript — to C# in .Net, I must admit I was a bit annoyed. Why do I need to declare every variable? What’s this “build” stuff? I was used to just throwing text files on the server and if they were broken, I would hear about it.

  I am a fan of subscription music services. I consider music a service, not a product. I am not interested in keeping track of what I own and where it’s stored. What I want is to queue up my tracks when and where I please — I don’t need to “own” anything to achieve that.
So I am a Rhapsody subscriber (after the Yahoo subscription service folded). The service is fine, but the user experience needs an overhaul.

  I don’t know what declaratory relief is, but clearly craigslist is on the right side of this argument. I am tempted to hire a South Carolinian hooker out of principle.

  …is someone I hadn’t heard of until I read this very amusing post: Ruby on Rails and the importance of being stupid. The comments are every bit as interesting as the article.
I like his economic thinking too, with obligatory reference to the excellent The Forgotten Man, which I am now “reading” (ie, glancing at, half-finished, on my desk).
I was a physics major, not a computer science guy. Turns out physics is great training for the problem-solving that programmers do.

  I’ve created an extension for BlogEngine.Net to improve typography. It “educates” the text, so that quotes and apostrophes are transformed into their smart (curly) counterparts. This blog uses it.
It’s called Educator and details are here.

  Yesterday’s discussion of nulls got me to thinking about this common bit of syntax in C#:
[code:c#]if (myObject == null)
{
…
[/code]
But here’s the thing: null is not data. It’s metadata. That is, it describes the state of a variable, not its contents.
Null indicates the absence of a value. So the above code says, is myObject’s value equal to not having a value? Seems strange.
Other languages seem to make this distinction.

  Eric Lippert has a worthwhile post about what nulls are and why we use them. I like reading Eric because I think we think alike — computer languages are languages, with grammar and semantics.
Thinking this way allows one to design architectures that are intuitive. After all, when you create an object model, you are effectively creating a domain-specific language. Even it it’s written in C#, GetWidgets() is only meaningful within your business.
