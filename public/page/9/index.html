		<h2>Microsoft’s political privacy game</h2>
		<p>
			I’ve suggested many times that Microsoft should disable third-party cookies by default in IE10 (and Safari does currently). This would be strategic for them: it devalues Google’s main income source and allows Microsoft to trumpet a commitment to privacy.

		<h2>The good might be the enemy of the perfect with software patents</h2>
		<p>
			I have a few concerns, relating to unintended consequences, with a proposed loser-pays bill on software patents.

		<h2>The quaintness of “content” vs “infrastructure”</h2>
		<p>
			Here’s a really informative article on the economics of Google’s fiber offer. One of the key takeaways is that Google’s ownership of high-bandwidth content (YouTube) gives them leverage in peering arrangements.

		<h2>Two, billion-dollar UI mistakes in Windows 8</h2>
		<p>
			I am very interested in Windows 8 both as a user and as a tech industry watcher. Big bet, big changes.

		<h2>Resolution vs “real estate”</h2>
		<p>
			The new Retina Macbook looks quite beautiful, but from a productivity standpoint I am a bit disappointed. While they have quadrupled the pixel count (to 2880 x 1800), they have not increased real estate, per se.

		<h2>Fluency</h2>
		<p>
			At my ripe old age one might expect me to give up programming and focus more on management. Which I do, if informally. But I have never seen the need to put aside programming in order to manage.

		<h2>This way madness lies (thankfully)</h2>
		<p>
			Tim Lee offers two views of the economic case for innovation. I am certainly more Hayekian — I think expertise and information is inherently dispersed and the Hayekian view is more granular, if you will. It’s more likely to discover and serve niches and inefficiencies.

	<a href="https://clipperhouse.com/conservative-and-liberal/">
		<h2>Conservative and liberal</h2>
		<p>
			The ideas of conservative and liberal have become very confused, and in many cases exactly backwards. Let’s try to understand them — as adjectives instead of nouns — and strip them of some connotations.
