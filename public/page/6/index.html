  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Chris Baus laments that developers are rarely impressed by other developers. It’s often true. But why are developers hard to (outwardly) impress?
For many of us, we base our identity on being special in a particular way: that we can see meaning in things that others find to be gibberish, like, say, computer code or big piles of raw data.
It is a direct tweak to our pleasure center when we have insights that others don’t....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I went to a talk last night by John Allspaw at Etsy, about alerts and how they are hard to get right.
The short story is, signal-to-noise. Most alerting systems don’t alert, because they are largely false-positive. Due to sheer volume, the recipients of those alerts start inventing their own subjective algorithm as to what deserves attention.
Those human factors are the hard part. Alerts require serious design, and need to be designed with the knowledge that they will be consumed in the context of several other alerting systems....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">At the risk of revealing my lack of a CompSci degree: what if ‘source code’ were replaced by serialized syntax trees?
What if the canonical ‘source’ of an application were not source code, as created by humans, but rather a serialized format of the syntax tree?
The workflow would go like this. You check out the repository. You make changes, and debug, to your satisfaction. Your local changes are still ‘source code’ as we currently understand it....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I use CoffeeScript here and there. And JavaScript everywhere else.
Depending on the scenario, and this is a matter of taste, CoffeeScript is more elegant, readable, and usable.
When offering this notion, inevitably there is a complaint about “debugging.” CS is generating code, it’s a layer of abstraction, which will lead to frustration, etc.
The question is, compared to what? When JavaScript is not behaving as you wish, what do you do?...</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Amtrak is improving its wifi, it claims. Fine. The problem is, it’ll never be faster than your phone’s 4G connection.
Why? Because Amtrak’s wifi uses the same 4G network. So take your 4G, send the bits through an additional router, contend with your neighbors’ bits, and you’ve got Amtrak wifi. (This is true of the wifi on the bus too, it’s not about Amtrak specifically.)
Now, in theory, there are some decent reasons to use their wifi....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">A French ISP has started blocking ads at the router level for its customers, enabled by default. Advertisers are, not surprisingly, upset.
What Free.fr is doing will probably not turn out to be legal. It’s clearly meant as a poke in the eye to content-driven advertisers like Google. It ensures a re-arguing of net neutrality.
What I haven’t heard is any objection by users. The move is, politics aside, a differentiator for the ISP’s service....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">That Apple, and other companies, are deciding to move manufacturing back to the United States is evidence of the diminishing importance of labor costs in decision-making. This implies several things.
Labor is around 4–5% of the retail cost for a computer, according to the article, and will continue to fall as automation increases. Labor costs are a bottom-line decision: a way to extract profit from a sale that has already happened....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">This article offers a lot of sound advice on hiring a designer. As techies, we’re often out of our depth in knowing what a good designer is — often, we hire a decorator instead (or as the article calls it, a stylist).
Style is important, but it’s not the main goal of design. Design encompasses the user’s whole experience. Design is the product.
The designer is the user’s advocate. I mean that in the full political sense: they are a public defender making the case for a client....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I’ve suggested many times that Microsoft should disable third-party cookies by default in IE10 (and Safari does currently). This would be strategic for them: it devalues Google’s main income source and allows Microsoft to trumpet a commitment to privacy.
This cookie-based approach would functionally prevent user information from going to third parties. (Microsoft has not made any commitment to setting this default.)
Microsoft has, however, chosen a more political path to the same goal, by sending a “Do Not Track” header in IE10....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Here’s a really informative article on the economics of Google’s fiber offer. One of the key takeaways is that Google’s ownership of high-bandwidth content (YouTube) gives them leverage in peering arrangements.
This is a lovely turnabout, in my opinion. It allows Google to hang carrots/wield sticks that most others can’t. Fighting incumbents ain’t beanbag.
There was a time when arguments about the net (neutrality in particular) hinged on a Luddish mental model that “content” and “infrastructure” were, and should be, different....</p>
