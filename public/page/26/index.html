  I’m excited about the new announcements from Apple today. Can’t wait to update my iPhone to the 3.0 OS and use the bitchen ZipCar app.
But it’s amazing how thick with spin the announcements are. Paul Thurrott offers a snarky take, and he’s largely right.
Apple feels the needs to dis Windows 7 as a minor update to Vista. And yet, that’s precisely what Snow Leopard is — a minor update to Leopard, as evidenced by its upgrade pricing of $29.

  If you use Twitter, you are familiar with URL shortening services like bit.ly and tinyurl.com. They are useful for saving characters in the space-limited messages that Twitter allows.
However, in using them you lose control of your URL. End users don’t know what site they are going to before they click on it. Plus, your domain name is part of your brand — you want people to see it.
To remedy this, I’ve created a URL shortener for ASP.

  Just experimenting a bit with using Windows Live Writer as a publishing tool for BlogEngine.Net. So far, it works really nicely. For one thing, it respects the theme of the blog right in the editing environment. Check it out:
That’s a local app you are looking at above, not this web site. After putting a screen shot in my post, it looks like a mirror reflecting a mirror. :)
The upside of using a local program for editing is faster saving of drafts plus nice conveniences like spell-checking.

  Google has released some preliminary versions of Chrome for Mac and Linux. They announced it almost apologetically.
Writing a browser is way harder than anything I’ll ever try. Hats off to those making the effort.
But the difficulty and time it’s taking for Google to match their Windows version of Chrome speaks to the continuing importance of the OS. After all, the browser depends on the operating system for lots of stuff.

  Dave Ward has updated his ASP.net implementation of Highslide, a very nice ajax-y photo browser. I like the idea of encapsulating javascript into controls, btw.

  Nice set of performance tips for jQuery selectors: http://www.artzstudio.com/2009/04/jquery-performance-rules/
They are all quite logical if you are used to selecting from data sets or file hierarchies. More specificity = faster selection; don’t do the same “query” twice.
Remember, the DOM is a data source. With an API as simple as jQuery’s, it’s easy to forget about the work being done underneath.

  I found a nice technique for automatically displaying the SVN revision number in the footer of a web site. It is based in CruiseControl.Net.
Why would I do this? Well, we don’t have a strict version numbering convention for our app. We roll out incremental builds all the time. This falls under the technique of “continuous integration”, or in Google’s case, “eternal beta”. So it’s easier just to have the app give itself an incremental version number each time, that corresponds with our build process.
