		<h2>Subscription media consolidation gets started</h2>
		<p>
			There are rumors that Amazon is interested in buying Netflix. I like the idea, though it’s just one step toward the sort of subscription media consolidation that I outlined a while ago.

		<h2>The iPhone needs multi-tasking, stat</h2>
		<p>
			Joshua Topolsky offers a very funny and insightful take on the iPhone’s very fundamental flaw: it is designed for doing one thing at a time. […] my work requires that I use a bunch of web tools, look at lots of news sites, and have a feed reader open… basically, things that would require some level of multitasking. Imagine the frustration of having to constantly break the connection in chat to go look at a site or work on a post. It’s frustrating, let me tell you. The idea of jumping into and out of applications — of having to actually quit an app to move to another one — is an incredibly outmoded and foreign idea in 2009 […] Funnily, the Safari experience provides better multitasking than the phone itself.

		<h2>The new wave of self-shorteners</h2>
		<p>
			So, my previous bit on the attraction of shortening one’s own URLs seems to have some traction. Obviously it wasn’t original to me, but I see that sites like Ars Technica and Flickr have begun doing their own URL shortening. Check it out:

		<h2>Why is a Social Security Number considered a secret?</h2>
		<p>
			Identity theft boggles my mind a bit. It’s no mystery why criminal enterprises attempt it. It’s a mystery that we have systems where public information is used for security.

		<h2>Use case: the metric system, or, all that useless beauty</h2>
		<p>
			Ah, nothing gets international rivalry boiling like soccer football and the metric system. One wonders why the metric system hasn’t taken off here in the US. I posit this: it doesn’t offer any advantage to end users, ie, regular citizens. Let’s do the use case.
