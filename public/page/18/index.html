		<h2>Wi-fi cafes in NYC</h2>
		<p>
			I’ve begun compiling a list of wi-fi cafes in New York City, with a bias toward those in my neighborhood. Hope it helps, and let me know of your finds.

		<h2>100% data loss at Coding Horror??</h2>
		<p>
			This can’t be good:
Can servers really fail that spectacularly? I mean, yes of course they can but something running on RAID 5 should be recoverable. For this to happen, it would require a lot of neglect plus a healthy dose of bad luck. Yikes.

		<h2>Browser-specific CSS without Javascript or horrible syntax</h2>
		<p>
			So, we all know that browsers have differing levels of CSS support. Working around them can be a pain in the a**, requiring non-standards-based hacks which are very hard to read and debug.

		<h2>Logic as data, and a case where strong typing impeded learning</h2>
		<p>
			These days, I am doing a lot of Javascript, or more accurately, a lot of jQuery. A concept I have gotten comfortable with is the idea of passing logic as data.

		<h2>{less} CSS for .Net</h2>
		<p>
			A while back I asked whether some enterprising-person-who-is-smarter-than-I would offer a version of the {less} CSS framework for .Net. Looks like they have, and they did it as I’d hoped: an HttpHandler mapped to the .less extension. So your .less files are compiled on the fly and served to the browser as plain ol’ CSS.
