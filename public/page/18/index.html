  So I’ve moved to a new place in NYC, and it’s a bit…cozier…than what I was used to in San Francisco. So I am looking for ways to save space and for now I’ve decided to go without a TV.
I do like TV, I admit. So am cobbling together a few ways to watch shows without paying for cable or buying another screen.
I’ve found that the state of television on the computer is still a bit DIY.

  Neat, if you type in a partial lyric to a song — without even referring to the title or artist — Google finds it and gives it to you to play right there.

  I rely on libraries (mostly jQuery) instead of writing a lot of serious JavaScript these days. I mean, of course I am writing JavaScript but the libraries allow me to stay in “script space” — small procedure bits that are scripts as opposed to applications.
But I do like to keep an eye on best practices, and this article offers some great tips from an experienced JS library developer.
He offers them in the context of ripping Google’s new Closure library — he says it’s evident that it was done by Java people without much real-world JavaScript experience.

  Rackspace has announced that they are getting into the Windows virtual machine bizness. I’ve been waiting for this market to heat up, and have competition drive down some prices.
RAM is everything, and the service providers usually make this the main spec you pay for. In virtual environments, it’s even more important since disk I/O tends to be especially slow — you want to keep as much in RAM as possible.

  Neat, Google has a new language called Go. Clever branding, that.
It seems to be Google’s attempt to step into the Java/C# space. Perhaps I don’t know enough about languages to make such an assertion, but the thing that clued me in was its type safety. That seems decidedly untrendy.
Google seems to have stepped over a basic OO concept: inheritance. Smart C# programmers know to use interfaces instead of inheritance, where possible.

  Joel Spolsky has an article in Inc describing the tension between growth and quality at his company. The issue is, if your competitor is outgrowing you, their dominance might become self-fulfilling: customers prefer a safe choice, and the safe choice is what other customers are buying. Even if your product is better, nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd.
Your competitor begins to look like Paris Hilton: famous for being famous.

  The flagship strategy of mobile phones — Microsoft needs one In the wake of the iPhone over the last few years, it seems that the market is responding to a business model different than the PC’s that preceded it. Mobile phones seem to require a very tight integration of hardware and software (and arguably service) to make a splash.
Apple fans will say, “Well, duh!”. But Apple lost the PC battle for 20 years.

  Apple has come out with version 3.0 of its Apple TV product, and it appears to be little more than a visual refresh with a couple of nice bits of iTunes integration. It still doesn’t do what we expect of a “set-top box” or “media center”: things like recording live TV.
The Apple TV is proving that it does not belong in those categories of hardware above. It’s more correct to think of it as an iTunes extender — an elegant way to get your movies and music onto the TV, assuming that iTunes is your starting point.

  A friend directed me to this site , belonging to a creative director at Squarespace, and containing the following message for IE6 users: Hi, if you are coming to this site via Internet Explorer 6, you might not be getting the best experience possible. Honestly, I can’t even begin to think about what your entire experience on the internet must be like? (…probably like riding a bike on the highway while cars blow by you on their way to Costco to get gallons of mayonnaise and 60-inch plasma TV’s).

  Via Silicon Alley Insider, an analysis by a company called Drake Direct claims that 1 in 4 pageviews in the US goes to Facebook.
Hmm. I don’t doubt that Facebook gets a truly enormous amount of traffic. But 25% of the Internet? This must be some sort of derivative or artificial metric. It’s not 1 of 4 of mine. I know a handful of people that might reach that percentage — but then that number of people represents only a sample of heavily-engaged users.
