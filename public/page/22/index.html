		<h2>When Apple aligns with a carrier, act II</h2>
		<p>
			Apple is not really a partnering company. They make their own hardware and software — and services like .Mac Mobile Me — to ensure a certain user experience. This is their offer, and it works.

		<h2>A thought experiment: serial vs parallel</h2>
		<p>
			Now that solid-state drives are arriving in the mainstream, I’ve been thinking about the implications of serial vs parallel and how they affect overall perceived performance. And by “perceived” I mean, what does the client — both the technical and human variety — experience?

		<h2>Is Google building an anti-spam empire?, or, size matters</h2>
		<p>
			Google acquired reCAPTCHA today, a company that provides a simple means of adding a spam-limiting mechanism to your site. (I’ve implemented it several times and I recommend it to clients.)

			I navigated on my computer to the web site called “The dullest blog in the world”. I was mildly amused for several minutes. After which, I visited other web sites.

		<h2>Your bottleneck is you, or, why I’ve stopped worrying about performance</h2>
		<p>
			Provocative headline, no? Let me explain.
Like Jeff Atwood, I consider end-user performance to be a feature. Pages should snap. It sends a very positive signal to customers, IMHO. And the site should snap with 10 or 10,000 users.

		<h2>What the heck is going on with Intel’s next-generation SSDs?</h2>
		<p>

		<h2>Scale means reversing your thinking on the database</h2>

			There are only a small number of sites in the world that require truly tremendous scale. Usually, this is referred to as “web scale”, and describes a site where the data is user-generated and highly dynamic. Among the first that come to mind are Facebook, Digg, MySpace and the like.
