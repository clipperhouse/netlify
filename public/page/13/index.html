		<h2>Ben Bernanke’s list of economic participants</h2>
		<p>
			Bernanke: “The Federal Reserve cannot solve all the economy’s problems on its own. That will take time and the combined efforts of many parties, including the central bank, Congress, the administration, regulators and the private sector.”

		<h2>A couple of easy wins with SQL indexes</h2>
		<p>
			I was lucky enough to watch a great talk by SQL expert Brent Ozar courtesy of Fog Creek. A couple of actionable takeaways that stuck with me are about creating and choosing indexes.

		<h2>Is Fred Wilson arguing for “Content Neutrality”?</h2>
		<p>
			Fred Wilson, whom I admire, comments on a recent dust-up where a content provider blocked their programming from customers of a specific ISP. This is the kind of stuff that should not happen on the web. […]I see more signs every day that we need some basic rules governing Internet access. Maybe we shouldn’t call it Net Neutrality. Maybe we should call it a bill of rights for consumers on the Internet.

		<h2>Market share for the taking, or, outrunning the bear</h2>
		<p>
			Much of the commentary I’ve seen for today’s announcement of Windows Phone 7 revolves around whether Microsoft can catch up with Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android. Fair enough; feature-wise, they are in the same ballpark.

		<h2>Avoiding “magic strings” in jQuery, C# and ASP.net MVC</h2>
		<p>
			The longer I program, the less tolerance I have for “magic strings”. You might be familiar with them — they are strings that have programmatic meaning but are trapped between quotes in another language.

		<h2>Sherman’s law of prior knowledge, or, predicting the past</h2>
		<p>
			“When a disaster happens, large or small, there is a 100% chance that a headline will be written claiming ignored warnings.” I’ve come to realize, that’s the narrative. It’s always the narrative, and the details of the incident matter little.

		<h2>When “infographics” jump the shark</h2>
		<p>

		<p>
			It’s cool that the EFF is offering a Firefox extension to use SSL where it’s available. I prefer to encrypt things too, but really, that’s the least of your problems.
