  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Fred Wilson, whom I admire, comments on a recent dust-up where a content provider blocked their programming from customers of a specific ISP. This is the kind of stuff that should not happen on the web. […]I see more signs every day that we need some basic rules governing Internet access. Maybe we shouldn’t call it Net Neutrality. Maybe we should call it a bill of rights for consumers on the Internet....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I was lucky enough to watch a great talk by SQL expert Brent Ozar courtesy of Fog Creek. A couple of actionable takeaways that stuck with me are about creating and choosing indexes.
Indexes in SQL for me are kind of a black art. You look at Query Execution plans, try to intuit where the work is being done, and then make a guess as to what index might help. Then you see if things are “faster”....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Much of the commentary I’ve seen for today’s announcement of Windows Phone 7 revolves around whether Microsoft can catch up with Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android. Fair enough; feature-wise, they are in the same ballpark.
But Microsoft need not triumph over the “big two” in terms of mindshare. In fact, Apple and Google aren’t the big two at all. Who is? Nokia and RIM.
Between them, their operating systems command around 60% of the mobile market — but this number falling rapidly....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">The longer I program, the less tolerance I have for “magic strings”. You might be familiar with them — they are strings that have programmatic meaning but are trapped between quotes in another language.
A classic example is SQL held in a string variable within your C#/PHP/whatever code. It might just as easily be HTML in your Javascript.
The problem is that this code is meaningless outside of its domain....</p>

Quick history: I decided to leave a comfortable job at a great design firm in early 2009 to pursue this idea, spent about a year getting things off the ground, and launched earlier this year. A couple of months ago I took an opportunity at Stack Overflow....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">“When a disaster happens, large or small, there is a 100% chance that a headline will be written claiming ignored warnings.” I’ve come to realize, that’s the narrative. It’s always the narrative, and the details of the incident matter little.
Apple Engineer Told Jobs IPhone Antenna Might Cut Calls
BP warned of rig fault ten years ago
Bush Warned of Hijackings Before 9⁄11
…etc. It’s not that any of these folks are blameless....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Mashable offers an “infographic” describing Google’s history in social networking. And it’s pretty and all well and good, except that the graphic adds no information.
Rather, it’s simply a set of data points that happen to have been put into an image. It’s as if Illustrator had an “Import from Excel” function.
Infographics are supposed to add information, by giving you a visual or intuitive sense of, say, proportion or relationships or trends....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">It’s cool that the EFF is offering a Firefox extension to use SSL where it’s available. I prefer to encrypt things too, but really, that’s the least of your problems.
As I am sure you know, HTTPS simply encrypts data between your computer and the web server, while it’s in transit. It does nothing to ensure that your data is handled correctly at the other end.
When you hear about credit card or other privacy breaches, it’s usually due to mishandling — databases that get into the wrong hands, or software flaws that reveal information....</p>

I’ve been a reader and admirer of Joel and Jeff for some years now, so I am thrilled to be working alongside them. (Hopefully they won’t catch on to the fact that I don’t write code, I merely copy-and-paste from Stack Overflow.)
In fact, I wasn’t really looking for a job, what with Alikewise and some freelance gigs I’ve been doing....</p>
