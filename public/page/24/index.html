		<h2>Tell me your favorite expression for “dead”</h2>
		<p>
			I was amused by this article’s title. So I’ve decided to compile clever expressions for “dead”. Tell me your faves in the comments below. I’ll update this page with the best ones.

		<h2>Killer app for the Zune HD: Tivo for radio</h2>
		<p>
			The upcoming Zune HD sounds pretty nice. I use my iPhone less as a recorded music device and more like a radio. I listen to podcasts or Pandora. Honestly, in the age of subscription media I have no interest in buying-and-syncing music.

		<h2>Random numbers web service</h2>
		<p>
			Generating numbers that are truly random is quite difficult. Every random number needs to be based on some starting place — the time of day in milliseconds, perhaps. As such it’s actually a predictable number; it’s deterministic, even if a regular human won’t realistically guess it.

		<h2>What is Google going to do with On2?</h2>
		<p>
			Google recently acquired On2, a company that creates video codecs, most notably for Flash (which is used on the most popular video sites). Dan Rayburn runs down and debunks a number of theories as to what Google has in mind. Rightly, he says that none are obviously correct.

		<h2>The most viable reason for Apple’s rejection of Google Voice (so far)</h2>
		<p>
			So, in the Apple-Google-AT&amp;T kerfuffle over Google Voice being rejected from the iPhone, I haven’t heard many reasons I consider viable. This one is: I’ve been asking myself exactly why Apple or AT&amp;T would stir up the hornet’s nest to deny the technology and risk the ire of both the government and one of their most valuable partners, and also why each company’s stance is full of contradictory actions.After a little reflection, the answer became resoundingly clear: Apple is building a similar service to add to MobileMe.
