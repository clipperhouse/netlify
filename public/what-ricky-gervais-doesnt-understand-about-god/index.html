			<h1>What Ricky Gervais doesn’t understand about God</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I am not a religious person. I also happen to believe that religious people bear the brunt of more everyday bigotry than most groups.</p>
<p>I have heard maybe two or three clearly racists sentiments in my life. By which I mean, uttered in my presence. I hear a similar number of slights against religious people every week, probably.</p>
<p>So upon reading Ricky Gervais’ <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/12/19/a-holiday-message-from-ricky-gervais-why-im-an-atheist/#">explanation of his atheism</a>, I had to cringe at his understanding of religion. It was, charitably, a (pedantic) swing and a (bigoted) miss.</p>
<p>What he fails to grasp is that <strong>faith is an aesthetic choice</strong>. It is not rational, and does not claim to be. When people are lifted up by a symphony, or saddened by a tragic play, they are undertaking the same, non-rational choice as people of faith. It is a decision to transcend, and be moved.</p>
<p>To invoke science in this is to <a href="http://www.paclink.com/~ascott/they/tamildaa.htm">dance about architecture</a>. Gervais says that,
Science is humble. It knows what it knows and it knows what it doesn’t know.</p>
<p>Yes, good science is humble. A good philosopher (of which the scientist is a species) learns humility very quickly.</p>
<p>A person of faith begins with this humility. A belief in God is fundamentally an admission of not knowing.</p>
<p>One does not invoke science in describing how they are moved by a piece of music. One can apply science to this experience (in terms of psychology and such), but your decision to fire up a Yeah Yeah Yeahs track is not a rational one. One might ask if Gervais’ comic inspiration is “rational”.</p>
<p>Why do I mention bigotry? Sentiments like these:
I would just rather you didn’t kill people who believe in a different god, say. Or stone someone to death because your rulebook says their sexuality is immoral.</p>
<p>Does he believe this to be the mainstream of religion? If he were living under a repressive theocracy, and observed these sorts of things on a regular basis, I might be sympathetic.</p>
<p>I rather suspect that he is using headlines generated by a few to impugn any others he includes in the category. A person that harrumphs “See?!” while watching a black guy being arrested on the evening news would be an intellectual compatriot of Gervais in this regard.</p>
<p>I might also point out that the great killers of the last 100 years were atheists. And not simply on a personal level — Hitler, Stalin and Mao considered the elimination of religion to be a fundamental part of their ideologies. Between them, we are looking at, conservatively, 20 million murders.</p>
<p>(We’d need 500 deaths by stoning, every day for the next 100 years, to approach that. I can be pedantic too!)</p>
<p>So believing that religion is a force for conflict and oppression, when compared to other belief systems, is simply…irrational.</p>
