			<h1>Every programming problem…</h1>
			<div>
				<p>…can be entirely described in these four dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cache:</strong> The browser is a cache for a web page, whose canonical version lives on a server. A web page is a cache for structured data, whose canonical version lives in (say) SQL. Structured data is a cache for bits that live on a spinning piece of rust. The questions for the programmer are, how similar is a piece of data to its canonical source, and how similar does it have to be?</li>
<li><strong>Abstractions:</strong> You’ve hidden some words behind a smaller number of words. What words are you really saying, when you say DoThing()? It’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">turtles</a> all the way down.</li>
<li><strong>Scope:</strong> What does this variable (symbol) mean at this moment? Will it mean the same thing a moment later, after we’ve gone off and done other stuff? There is a symbol over there which seems to be the same guy. Is it? And if I change it here, what happens elsewhere?</li>
<li><strong>Delimiters:</strong> Aka encoding. Nothing is understandable without rules describing where meaning begins and ends. White space is a delimiter between commands in your programs. Slashes are delimiters in URLs. HTML, JSON, GZIP: defined by delimiters and encoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every bug fix is an exercise in asking one of these questions until the answer is satisfactory.</p>
