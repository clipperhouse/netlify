			<h1>Championship</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Engineering and product managers often talk about “ownership” of features, when what we want is <strong>championship</strong>. When we orient ourselves around <em>assignment</em> of tasks, we ship a worse product.</p>
<p>We should want individuals to choose projects that they will champion, i.e., for which they are <strong>advocates</strong>. This is better for the individual, better for the user, better for the company – and it keeps us managers accountable.</p>
<h3 id="intrinsic-motivation">Intrinsic motivation</h3>
<p>We do better work when we are intrinsically motivated. In engineering, this means better correctness, better performance, more edge cases discovered and addressed. We incentivise craftsmanship: when the implementer cares, the user gets a better product.</p>
<p>My (decidedly unscientific) heuristic is that championed work ships product that is 2× better than assigned work.</p>
<p>And it makes for happier, more invested developers, who stick around.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-managers-accountable">Keeping managers accountable</h3>
<p>When deciding priorities, we managers are more hand-wavy than we’d like to think. Championship provides an empirical test for our hypotheses.</p>
<p>What if we’ve proposed a project and declared its priority, and yet found no takers? The absence of a champion is an opportunity to <strong>debug our beliefs</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did our idea just fail its first market test – with a friendly audience, no less?</li>
<li>Did we fail to persuade? Persuasion is an obligation of leadership.</li>
<li>Did we commit to other priorities, therefore making this new priority…not?</li>
</ul>
<p>This all sounds idealistic, I know! What about unglamorous projects like tech debt and compliance? Up next, <a href="/championship-in-practice/">how it worked on my team at Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
