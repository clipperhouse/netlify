			<h1>Is Fred Wilson arguing for “Content Neutrality”?</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Fred Wilson, whom I admire, <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/10/a-net-neutrality-case-study.html">comments</a> on a recent dust-up where a content provider blocked their programming from customers of a specific ISP.
This is the kind of stuff that should not happen on the web. […]I see more signs every day that we need some basic rules governing Internet access. Maybe we shouldn’t call it Net Neutrality. Maybe we should call it a bill of rights for consumers on the Internet.</p>
<p>This turns the Net Neutrality argument on its head. The essence of NN is that network providers should transfer all bits from all content providers with equal treatment.</p>
<p>But the network provider in this case did nothing, and so the episode has nothing to do with network neutrality. The content publisher chose not to deliver their programming to a certain audience — which is what publishers of every stripe do every day.</p>
<p>Fred seems to be arguing for Content Neutrality, that publishers must make all their content available to everyone. This is either a radical redefinition of Net Neutrality, or a demonstration of how slippery and ad hoc the definition is.</p>
<p>Not every newsstand carries every magazine and newspaper. Cable systems don’t carry every channel on every plan. Some publishers choose markets by geography or by income level.</p>
<p>These would be violations of Content Neutrality. They are also successful models which provide customers with different products for different desires and price points. (It also looks a lot like free speech, btw.)</p>
<p>Imagine if you, the web site operator, had to provide proof that you are delivering all your bits without discrimination. Blocked any IP’s lately? Shut down any undesirable accounts?</p>
<p>I understand that this episode is not desirable, but the fix is in incentives, not rule-making. The content provider in this case did itself no favors, and quickly reversed its policy. Let them lose customers to their competitors.</p>
<p>Simply put, the content providers own the content, and its disposition is their choice. Ditto the network provider. Attempts at managing distribution with top-down rules have generally been a tragedy in other markets.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Net Neutrality, combined with Content Neutrality, should have a new definition. Let’s call it the Managed Web. Sound good?</p>
