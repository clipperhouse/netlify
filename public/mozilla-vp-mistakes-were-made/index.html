			<h1>Mozilla VP: “mistakes were made”</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I love the language of Mozilla VP Mike Shaver’s <a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2009/10/18/update-net-framework-assistant-clickonce-support-unblocked/">non-retraction retraction</a> regarding a Microsoft plugin for Firefox:
We received confirmation from Microsoft this evening that the Framework Assistant add-on is not a mechanism for exploiting the vulnerabilities detailed in <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/security/2009/10/16/net-framework-assistant-blocked-to-disarm-security-vulnerability/">the earlier post</a>, so we’ve removed it from the blocklist.</p>
<p>Hee hee. In other words, there was not a security vulnerability, although we <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/security/2009/10/16/net-framework-assistant-blocked-to-disarm-security-vulnerability/">stated unequivocally</a> that there was, and others quickly <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/091017/p12#a091017p12">parroted same</a>.</p>
<p>Shaver added,
“It’s not that we were wrong, but for the benefit of our users we have realigned our correctness vectors.”</p>
<p>(I might have made up that last quote.)</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>An update: it looks like the security alerts were a joint effort between Microsoft and Mozilla. Perhaps my sarcasm was a bit hasty, it sounded like evasion to me. But it appears that indeed, Microsoft was driving it as much as Moz.</p>
