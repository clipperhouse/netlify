			<h1>Saying true things is hard</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I think the replication &amp; open science movement is great. I come from an epistemological, first-principles sort of mindset, and so I find this very encouraging:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We replicated 21 social science experiments in Science or Nature. We succeeded with 13. Replication effect sizes were half of originals. All materials, data, code, &amp; reports: <a href="https://t.co/Uq1R5SUHNo">https://t.co/Uq1R5SUHNo</a>, preprint <a href="https://t.co/aDEctL7yUx">https://t.co/aDEctL7yUx</a>, Nature Human Behavior <a href="https://t.co/5VSJ86avAC">https://t.co/5VSJ86avAC</a> <a href="https://t.co/dVrSK922Cb">pic.twitter.com/dVrSK922Cb</a></p>&mdash; Brian Nosek (@BrianNosek) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianNosek/status/1034093429507141639?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>We should conclude that <strong>saying true things is hard</strong>. Here’s why.</p>
<p>In the context of the above, let’s consider that these experiments were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performed by scientists</li>
<li>First-hand</li>
<li>Over weeks or months</li>
<li>Peer reviewed</li>
<li>Accepted by professional journals</li>
</ul>
<p>…and were still <strong>only 60% right</strong>. Moreso, the effect sizes were ½ of the original claims.</p>
<p>We, as readers, then might take this as evidence we should apply (say) <strong>30% confidence</strong> (60 × ½) to new scientific claims.</p>
<p>That’s rough. Now! Consider that most reporting on science is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Written by non-scientists</li>
<li>Second-hand</li>
<li>Over hours or days</li>
<li>(Hopefully) edited and fact-checked</li>
<li>Published by consumer-oriented outlets</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s set aside notions of obvious bias or incentives – that debate is speculative, subjective, and hard to agree on. Let’s stipulate that everyone in the ‘signal chain’ is well-intended, smart and professional.</p>
<p>Even under ideal circumstance, such popular ‘re-broadcast’ should be understood as ‘signal loss’ applied to our baseline of 30% confidence.</p>
<p>What to do? As readers, the healthy approach is to assume most of our conclusions, from most reading, should be held very weakly – because saying true things is hard.</p>
