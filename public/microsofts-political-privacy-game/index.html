			<h1>Microsoft’s political privacy game</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I’ve suggested many times that Microsoft should disable third-party cookies by default in IE10 (and Safari <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/features.html#security">does</a> currently). This would be strategic for them: it devalues Google’s main income source and allows Microsoft to trumpet a commitment to privacy.</p>
<p>This cookie-based approach would <em>functionally</em> prevent user information from going to third parties. (Microsoft has not made any commitment to setting this default.)</p>
<p>Microsoft has, however, chosen a more <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/microsoft-sticks-to-its-guns-keeps-do-not-track-on-by-default-in-ie10/">political path</a> to the same goal, by sending a “Do Not Track” header in IE10.</p>
<p>It’s political because the DNT has no <em>functional</em> value — it does nothing to prevent information from going to third-parties. Instead, it sends a notification to advertisers that the user <em>wishes</em> not to be tracked. The advertiser then makes a choice about whether to comply.</p>
<p>Advertisers — including presumably Google — are upset because this looks like future legal liability. Perhaps a lawsuit is brought, on behalf of a user or a class, saying, “look, I told you not to track me, but you did”.</p>
<p>The DNT header currently has no legal status (AFAIK) and is merely a standard ratified by an industry group. However, the gov’t is <a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2010/12/ftc-do-not-track/">supportive</a>.</p>
<p>I understand Microsoft’s political canniness in this, but I hate this sort of regulatory competition. It’s not unlike defensive (or offensive) patents: one company says to another, hey, I’d hate to see an expensive trial for you in the future.</p>
<p>Disabling cookies achieves the goal by competing on product; the DNT header uses legal risk as a weapon.</p>
