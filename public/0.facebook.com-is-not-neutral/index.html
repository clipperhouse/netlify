			<h1>0.facebook.com is not neutral</h1>
			<div>
				<p>A while back I mentioned the idea that some <a href="http://richvsreach.wordpress.com/2008/06/03/the-long-game-on-metered-pricing-free-shipping/">content sites would offer free shipping</a> for their bits. It would be the inevitable result of metered pricing on the Internet, an idea with which major (wired) carriers are experimenting.</p>
<p>For example, ESPN might make a deal with Comcast to say “any video from ESPN flowing over Comcast’s network will not count against the customer’s bandwidth bill.” Basically, ESPN becomes toll-free for the customer, not unlike an 800 number.</p>
<p>It turns out Facebook is the <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=391295167130">first to do this</a>, and they are doing it on wireless networks where bandwidth is — ding ding — metered. They made deals with a bunch of wireless carriers. This seems like a win-win-win; Facebook is (presumably) compensating the carriers; Facebook gets to tell their customers that they are free to use, increasing their traffic; and customers save money.</p>
<p>But is this a neutral arrangement, in the sense of net neutrality? Clearly not. <strong>Facebook’s bits are being delivered at a different price than other sites.</strong> That sort of thing certainly seems to be the fear of net neutrality advocates. What the advocates misunderstand is that non-neutral networks can be better for the consumer, as in the case above.</p>
<p>What’s less likely is that a carrier would charge more for a YouTube; what’s more likely is that YouTube would subsidize the consumer. In other words, by making “upcharges” illegal, net neutrality would also make discounts illegal.</p>
<p>“Neutral” means neither positive nor negative, and it means that differences (and experimentation and variety) are prohibited — even if those differences benefit the consumer.</p>
