			<h1>Having the courtesy to be wrong</h1>
			<div>
				<p>One characteristic I see in accountable managers is having <strong>the courtesy to be wrong</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="meet-jan">Meet Jan</h3>
<p>Jan is an executive at a previous employer of mine, who had strong beliefs about product direction. We pursued the direction. The bet didn’t pan out as we hoped. Jan stepped down.</p>
<p>Now, I disagreed with parts of her strategy (easy in hindsight!), but I respected Jan’s being clear on what she believed. Her position was unambiguous enough that it might be proved one way or the other, and thus Jan made herself accountable.</p>
<p>She had the courtesy to be wrong.</p>
<p>In a traditional view, you might think a management team should aim to have fewer Jan’s – her strategy didn’t work out! – but most teams have a bigger problem.</p>
<h3 id="meet-carl">Meet Carl</h3>
<p>Many managers perfect the art of never being particularly wrong (or right). Let’s call this style Carl.</p>
<p>Carl is highly  <a href="https://work.qz.com/1309735/adam-grant-the-best-employees-are-not-the-agreeable-ones/">agreeable</a>, but at the end of the day, he does little that risks being wrong. His ideas are fine and useful, but it’s hard to test outcomes of his beliefs.</p>
<p>Unlike Jan, Carl will never be particularly accountable – and, synonymously, makes little difference to the organization. I find this uncourteous.</p>
<h3 id="falsifiable">Falsifiable</h3>
<p>Before we can know an idea’s merit, we must understand its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiability</a>. Jan values falsifiability where Carl does not.</p>
<p>When an idea is falsifiable, we can bring evidence to bear. In turn, observable evidence allows others in the organization to contribute – to analyze, criticize, and refine. The harder an idea is to pin down, the harder it is to make progress.</p>
<p>The best organizations aim for <strong>falsifiable outcomes first</strong>, and positive outcomes second.</p>
<h3 id="divisive">Divisive</h3>
<p>A falsifiable belief is often a <strong>divisive</strong> one. I got this notion from Chris Coyne, a founder of OKCupid: divisive questions have high information content; anodyne questions, not so much.</p>
<p>OKCupid’s ideal was to ask its users questions with a 50 / 50 (divisive!) split of answers. This offers more signal for matching.</p>
<h3 id="bad-questions-examples-mine">Bad questions (examples mine):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is ice cream delicious?</li>
<li>Are puppies cute?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions might split 95 / 5, and are therefore uninformative.</p>
<h3 id="better-questions">Better questions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Should you correct people on grammar?</li>
<li>Who did you vote for?</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases, we might imagine something closer to a 50 / 50 split, and therefore having a fighting chance of learning something.</p>
<p>As managers, we should ask ourselves if we are making assertions that anyone could possibly disagree with. If an idea is about as divisive as puppies, we might be working with a Carl.</p>
