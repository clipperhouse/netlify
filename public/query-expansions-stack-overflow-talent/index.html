			<h1>Query expansions in Stack Overflow Talent</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Stack Overflow Talent aims to connect the right company with the right developer. We call this a two-sided market – developers on one side and recruiters on the other.</p>
<p>One challenge is that the recruiter side of the market is <strong>not always technical</strong>. Many clients struggle to understand technology skill sets and ecosystems.</p>
<p>This is understandable! It’s a jungle of jargon (a jargle?) out there, and those of us on the inside don’t realize how inscrutable it all is.</p>
<p>This plays out in Stack Overflow’s candidate database, a product offered to recruiters to search for candidates of different skills. (Developers can <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/jobsearch/current">opt in</a> to this database with their developer story.)</p>
<p>The candidate database uses Elastic on the back end. Elastic is pretty good out of the box, but like other databases, it’s quite literal – to get a match, you have to search for <strong>precise terms</strong> that appear in developer stories.</p>
<p>We observed that recruiters’ search terms didn’t always meet this standard. For example, ‘front end’ is a common search, as are ‘mobile’ and ‘.Net’. Some developers use those terms in their developer stories, but more often, skills are expressed more granularly.</p>
<p><em>We</em> know that an Angular expert is a front end person; we know that iOS implies mobile, and that C# is .Net – but databases such as Elastic do not.</p>
<p>The result is that recruiters miss good, appropriate candidates (which we heard quite a lot from Stack’s customer success team).</p>
<h3 id="query-expansions-v1">Query expansions, v1</h3>
<p>We asked our customer success folks: how do you advise clients to find (e.g.) front end developers? The response was ‘search instead for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap…’.</p>
<p>Great advice. But shouldn’t the system already know this?</p>
<p>So we made the system know that. The first implementation (by me) was crude as could be, in order to test the theory as cheaply as possible.</p>
<p>We intercepted the raw query text and literally did a string replace: <code>s/front end/html javascript css react bootstrap/</code>. In this way, <strong>queries are expanded</strong> into richer search terms (invisibly to the end user).</p>
<p>We eyeballed the search results, got feedback from the customer success team, and put it into production. The results, while anecdotal, were positive.</p>
<p>In turn, we repeated this process for other common search terms: sysadmin, mobile, data science. We sprinkled in some regex to tolerate minor variations.</p>
<h3 id="query-expansions-v2">Query expansions, v2</h3>
<p>We solved some obvious problems, but one can see the limits in the above approach. Substrings are a problem, as are n-grams.</p>
<p>The next step was to move this logic down into the <strong>query-parsing infrastructure</strong>. By doing so, we operate on a real syntax tree, with real tokens, and avoid “stringy” edge cases. We added a <a href="https://www.benjamin.pizza/posts/2017-11-13-recursion-without-recursion.html">simple library</a> for making substitutions, and eliminated regex.</p>
<h3 id="trade-offs">Trade-offs</h3>
<p>There is a bit of a performance hit in the database with long <code>OR</code> statements, on the order of 10% if I recall. We consider this acceptable for the improvement in user outcomes.</p>
<p>A further optimization might be to move expansions into Elastic itself, by writing an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-analyzers.html">analyzer</a>. Think of it as an ‘expansion in reverse’: when (say) ‘css’ is detected in a document, tag the document with the term ‘front end’, which can be indexed and searched efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3>
<p>As of this writing, Stack Overflow Talent offers query expansions for a few dozen common search terms (examples below). The result is that the customer success team needs to recommend ‘tips and tricks’ less often; demos by salespeople are more impressive; and most importantly, developers are more likely to be found by the right companies.</p>
