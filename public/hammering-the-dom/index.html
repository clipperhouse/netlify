			<h1>Hammering the DOM</h1>
			<div>
				<p>As I work on my ASP.net <a href="/jQuery/">jQuery controls</a>, I got to thinking about what “animations” really are. The core animation framework in jQuery (as far as I can tell) is to simply iterate in small steps between two CSS states. So if you are going from 0% opacity to 100% opacity, jQuery applies (say) 100 CSS changes in 1% increments.</p>
<p>This is essentially hammering the DOM. The browser is forced to make 100 updates to the state of an element, and re-render it, over a short period of time. This must incur a lot of overhead. Indeed, I see very different degrees of “smoothness” on different browsers.</p>
<p>There must be a better way. Wouldn’t it be better to tell the browser: “transition smoothly between these two states”, and have it happen natively?</p>
<p>Considering the horsepower on most computers, a simply fade should be trivial in terms of computing effort. Even better, imagine if the browser could offload it to a video card?</p>
<p>Thinking further: wouldn’t it be great if jQuery could take advantage of such a thing?</p>
<p>A little research led me to <a href="http://weston.ruter.net/projects/jquery-css-transitions/">this</a>. Indeed, Webkit does have proprietary native support for such animations. Weston Ruter created a shim to use the native transition where available.</p>
<p>I’d like to see jQuery adopt this approach. Preserve the API — eg, $(“p”).fadeOut() — but change the underlying implementation based on browser capabilities. More capable browsers get smooter animations, less capable browsers do things the old way (circa 2009!).</p>
<p>This would move jQuery toward being more of an API than an animation engine. I think that’s a fine thing.</p>
<p>— -</p>
<p>Update: Indeed it has already been <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/css-animations-and-javascript/">discussed</a> over at jQuery. Sounds like John Resig sees a couple of dealbreakers in the current technologies.</p>
