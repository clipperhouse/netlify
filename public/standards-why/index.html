			<h1>Standards: why?</h1>
			<div>
				<p>There has been some fun stuff today following Steve Jobs <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">missive</a> on Flash and standards. <a href="http://twitter.com/joehewitt">Joe Hewitt</a> (former Facebook and Mozilla dev and rock star):
How it should go: browsers innovate differently, users pick the best one, later W3C standardizes what users chose, losing browsers conform.</p>
<p><a href="http://sachin.posterous.com/the-web-sucks">Sachin</a>:
Browsers aren’t innovating. They are just <em>trying</em> to comply with standards and fix bugs and performance</p>
<ul>
<li>Right now browser updates fix bugs and add application features, but can’t enhance the functionality of the web. This is only done by standards boards.</li>
<li>Browsers are forced to implement every “standard” that is agreed on, even if it’s not the best decision for the platform.</li>
<li>Browsers don’t add functionality outside of standards because developers wouldn’t utilize them. This means they can’t innovate.</li>
<li>Browsers don’t even comply with standards well. Developing for the web is a disaster because every browser has its own quirks and issues. They can’t even do one thing right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which got me to thinking about the case of web browser standards: what good are they?</p>
<p>On a base level, a piece of software has to comply with some standards to be called a web browser. Can it render HTML, CSS and JS? OK, it’s probably a web browser.</p>
<p>But beyond that, the passion for standardization is about one particular use case: the ability to switch between different brands of software and achieving the same experience.</p>
<p>Think about that. If all browsers do the same thing, why would anyone switch? Do you know any normal (non-techie) person who cares about their web browser? And as browsers converge on standards, they will have even <em>less</em> reason to care.</p>
<p><strong>Switching is a use case that applies to almost no one.</strong> And yet we obsess about it.</p>
<p>iPhone apps are not based on a community standard, and they often rock. People certainly like them.</p>
<p>Browser innovation <em>is</em> happening, and I am glad. I love Chrome. It competes on performance and usability. Firefox does the same, plus their add-on ecosystem.</p>
<p>And I understand the downside of inconsistent browsers. As a web dev, I benefit from standards. But does the consumer?</p>
<p>Consider what we are losing: serious innovation. It’s all happening elsewhere. Yes, browser standards do evolve as with HTML5. But as Hewitt <a href="http://twitter.com/joehewitt/status/13097165783">alludes to</a>, HTML5 is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#History_2">Flash 2003</a>. If we had waited for HTML5, we’d have no web video.</p>
<p>Heck, I was able to do things with Filemaker in the early 90’s that I still couldn’t do on the Web in the mid-00’s. I traded “rich” for “reach”. Maybe rich is fighting back.</p>
