			<h1>Leopard : Snow Leopard :: Vista : Windows 7</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I’m excited about the new announcements from Apple today. Can’t wait to update my iPhone to the 3.0 OS and use the bitchen ZipCar app.</p>
<p>But it’s amazing how thick with spin the announcements are. Paul Thurrott offers a <a href="http://community.winsupersite.com/blogs/paul/archive/2009/06/08/wwdc-2009-time-for-a-reality-check.aspx">snarky take</a>, and he’s largely right.</p>
<p>Apple feels the needs to dis Windows 7 as a minor update to Vista. And yet, that’s precisely what Snow Leopard is — a minor update to Leopard, as evidenced by its upgrade pricing of $29.</p>
<p>Hey, as a nerd, I get plenty excited about under-the-covers refinements. Apple is doing a lot of stuff that end-users won’t see, but which improve performance and capabilities.</p>
<p>Apple’s support of 64-bit looks a lot like Microsoft’s: it’s there is you want it but a lot of bits still run as 32. (Which makes little difference to the end user.) Windows 64 is actually more mainstream: walk into a Best Buy and you’ll find plenty of 64-bit Vista machines.</p>
<p>And Apple’s new Expose refinements look like they took a few cues from Win 7’s Aero Peek.</p>
<p>Poor us: two big computer companies falling over themselves to make things better and cheaper.</p>
