			<h1>Design is information</h1>
			<div>
				<p>It seems to me the companies with the greatest customer loyalty are those where design has a strong presence in the corporate culture. I don’t mean this in a touchy-feely way. I mean that customer loyalty is worth billions of dollars, and most companies see fit to leave that on the table.</p>
<p>Design is product. Fonts and colors are not design — they are <strong>decoration</strong>. Design is the hard work of understanding everything a customer might do, or want to do, how they will do it, and how they will be rewarded. It is an evaluation of the customer’s cost/benefit.</p>
<p>Design should report into the c-suite, or be in the c-suite. Two companies where this is the case: <a href="http://blog.archit.in/2011/03/john-sculley-on-steve-jobs-apple-and-microsoft/">Apple</a> (natch) and financial newcomers <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2011/04/jack-dorsey-201104">Square</a>. I see raves about Square all the time. Those raves are customers that will tell ten friends or 1000 Twitter followers. Try purchasing that goodwill via traditional marketing.</p>
<p>More than anything, <strong>design is information</strong>. It is a specification. It requires us to articulate what we are selling. Until we have a design, we don’t know what the user will experience, and therefore don’t know what our product is.</p>
<p>Everything we do as programmers is based on our own tacit assumptions about what the product should be. We think of ourselves as logical creatures. But our premise — “this is what the customer wants” — is often so unempirical and unexplored as to make the whole enterprise a bit, um, onanistic.</p>
<p>Implementation without design is reason is pursuit of folly.</p>
