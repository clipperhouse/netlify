			<h1>Labor costs make way for Maslow</h1>
			<div>
				<p>That Apple, and other companies, are deciding to <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/why-apple-got-a-made-in-u-s-a-bug/">move manufacturing</a> back to the United States is evidence of the diminishing importance of labor costs in decision-making. This implies several things.</p>
<p>Labor is around 4–5% of the retail cost for a computer, according to the article, and will continue to fall as automation increases. Labor costs are a <strong>bottom-line decision</strong>: a way to extract profit from a sale that has already happened.</p>
<p>As labor costs become less important, companies will instead look for <strong>gains on the top-line</strong>: competitive advantage that results in the sale being made in the first place. Shipping more quickly, customizing for local markets, and “Made in [your country here]” branding are aided by manufacturing locally.</p>
<p>Another way to think of it is a move up Maslow’s hierarchy. The basic need of manufacturing is satisfied at a low cost, such that it is no longer a focus of companies. Looking up the hierarchy, firms appeal to their customers’ more refined concerns.</p>
<p>Further, one hopes this change will obviate complaints that China and low-wage countries are “stealing jobs”. On the one hand, it neutralizes nativist, uneconomic arguments — a good thing. On the other, low-wage manufacturing is a large part of Chinese citizens’ enormous move up from poverty in recent decades — if “low-wage” is no longer a competitive advantage, the bottom might drop out.</p>
<p>Our assumptions about “cheap” Chinese manufacturing and its role in the world economy are likely to change more quickly than we realize.</p>
