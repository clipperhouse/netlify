			<h1>A market opportunity for Verizon and Sprint</h1>
			<div>
				<p>In the current <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/why-the-fcc-wants-to-smash-open-the-iphone/">FCC-involved kerfuffle</a> over why Apple or AT&amp;T blocked Google Voice on the iPhone, I see opportunity.</p>
<p>I am not convinced that AT&amp;T is the reason for blocking the app. It certainly could be, but from a technical perspective, a Google Voice call is the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/07/28/google-voice-iphone/">same as an AT&amp;T call</a>. It doesn’t strain their network.</p>
<p>The only person to touch on a plausible explanation is Michael Arrington who notes that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/i-quit-the-iphone/">number portability is the real bugaboo</a> from AT&amp;T’s perspective. But keep in mind that AT&amp;T allows Google Voice on Blackberries, on the same network.</p>
<p>What’s being missed is that <strong>this is a huge opportunity for Sprint and Verizon</strong>. They can simply announce that, hey, if you want Google Voice, come to our network. Use it on an Android, Blackberry or (hopefully soon) a Palm Pre. Lots of passionate folks would give up the iPhone for Google’s killer app. Palm and Google would have great incentive to buddy up and makes this seamless.</p>
<p>At which point, Apple and AT&amp;T would then be forced to respond and would likely grit their teeth and support it too. Everyone — well, every consumer — wins.</p>
<p>I am sad to see the FCC involved, when the above solution is so much better. If AT&amp;T or Apple were monopolists, there might be a reason for them to step in. But litigation costs always end up borne by the consumer.</p>
