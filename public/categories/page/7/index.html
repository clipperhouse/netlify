  I have a few concerns, relating to unintended consequences, with a proposed loser-pays bill on software patents.
I quite like the idea of loser-pays, and it is the standard in many parts of the world. And I certainly don’t like the current state of affairs with software patents. But the intended narrowness of the bill may make things worse.
Firstly, it attempts to define a software patent as anything that might be implemented on a computer.

  I am very interested in Windows 8 both as a user and as a tech industry watcher. Big bet, big changes.
Given the size of the bet, I believe Microsoft is making two UI mistakes that will cost them billions if they are released.
It took me, a developer and lifelong Windows user, quite a while to figure out how to search from the start screen. There is no search box.

  The new Retina Macbook looks quite beautiful, but from a productivity standpoint I am a bit disappointed. While they have quadrupled the pixel count (to 2880 x 1800), they have not increased real estate, per se.
In other words, the number of windows or characters or columns displayable on the screen has not changed — it is essentially a 1440 x 900 pixel display with increased sharpness. It’s like a new printer with a higher dpi, but the same paper size.

  At my ripe old age one might expect me to give up programming and focus more on management. Which I do, if informally. But I have never seen the need to put aside programming in order to manage.
Good programmers inevitably end up promoted into a management role. It’s a hard role: the demands on one’s time, and the sources of one’s satisfaction, change dramatically.
Too often, this means that one no longer writes production code.

  Tim Lee offers two views of the economic case for innovation. I am certainly more Hayekian — I think expertise and information is inherently dispersed and the Hayekian view is more granular, if you will. It’s more likely to discover and serve niches and inefficiencies.
I think Tim hits the nail on the head that: Building an iPad didn’t just require millions of dollars, it required that those millions be spent by the right company.

  The ideas of conservative and liberal have become very confused, and in many cases exactly backwards. Let’s try to understand them — as adjectives instead of nouns — and strip them of some connotations.
A conservative idea is one that sees value in limiting change. The assumption is that an organic system is a long accretion of wisdom or value, and should not be changed lightly. The built-up information in the system might not be obvious, and so changing it risks a greater loss than one anticipates.

  We’ve got a few hundred folks using Better Bird, my Chrome extension for fixing the Twitter web UI, and I’m thrilled.
I need feedback on what to do next. What do you think?

  It occurs to me, as I look at my Google+ stream for the first time in two months, the reason I never use it: it never had a chance to grow on me.
It’s beautifully implemented. It fills in niches that other platforms miss. It’s not an imitation of Facebook or Twitter (though it is obviously a reaction to those things).
No, the problem is that it is inorganic. It revealed itself to the world fully formed.

  Consider for a moment the logic of the leading paragraph of this article: Research suggests that consumers spend only about one second looking at nutrition information when making myriad choices. A parent dashing through the grocery store aisles with kids in tow has to decide, in that one second, which is better: Triscuit vs. Saltines vs. Wheat Thins vs. Ritz? This is why Americans need a simple, standardized and truthful label on the front of all packaged foods.

  While “truthy” values in JavaScript can cause no small amount of heartache, one must admit they help readability. For objects anyway, it’s very nice to say if (object) {…} and get on with business. If the object is null or undefined, “false” strikes me as a perfectly legitimate behavior in that context.
I’d love to see something similar in C# — not truthiness, but an implicit test for existence.
Every object in C# has a ToString method.
