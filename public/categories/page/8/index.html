  There are rumors afoot that Apple will offer TV channels as apps in an upcoming release. This might work as an interim idea, but it has no legs long-term.
This idea is not new — for years, people have been arguing for “a la carte” cable television. The idea being, instead of simply signing up for several dozen channels, a consumer might instead select their own menu of individual channels, and pay accordingly.

  You watch a movie. In order to get something from it, you have to enter the world that it presents. You must suspend disbelief.
This is essential for the product to work correctly. If you are unwilling to believe, say, that space mercenaries have Wookiee friends, or that the bumbling Bluth family exists — then it’s very unlikely the product is for you.
Restated, you know full well that none of what you perceive actually exists, but you believe it in order to get something out of the experience.

  I created a Chrome extension to fix what I think are some rough edges and poor choices in the Twitter web app. Have a look:
Some things it does:
 Moves the content to the left side, where it should be. Resolves t.co, bit.ly and other shortened links, so you know where you are clicking. Widens the content and optionally uses a nicer font. Exposes your Saved Searches, which are otherwise obscured, and notifies you of new matches.

  As I’ve written in the past, there are several unique inefficiencies to the Manhattan apartment market. Many can’t be helped in the short term, owing to an endemically tight market.
One that can be helped is information asymmetry. Brokers consider the simple knowledge of an available apartment to be proprietary information. That’s absurd, and serves no one’s interests except the middleman.
Obviously, prospective renters would like to know more about an apartment before pursuing it.

  I was chatting with my colleagues at Stack Exchange the other day and we wondered what it means to “own” a data type.
The best recent example is Twitter. They effectively “own” the format of short, one-to-many messaging. Their “product”, the web app, is good but not that compelling on its own. The fact that everyone who wants to participate in their particular communication protocol needs to pass through their “switchboard” — well, that is compelling.

  The Manhattan apartment rental market is unique, as anyone who has experienced it will tell you. The very low vacancy rate (high demand) allows for behavior that other markets don’t bear.
The first is the idea of a broker for trivial transactions. Many (most?) apartment buildings require that you go through a broker, paying a fee between 1–2 months’ rent.
This is not a “broker” in the sense of someone who saves you time by shopping on your behalf (though some do that).

  I was at the PIPA/SOPA protest in front of the offices of Senators Schumer and Gillibrand today. All fine and good, but why should the senators care?
The immediate answer is, they won’t…but bear with me.
These senators, like others, succeed because they are able to monetize their influence. This means that they expect would-be influencers — like, say, the entertainment or technology or finance industries — to put their money where their mouths are.

  Having learned that both the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO support SOPA, it’s becoming clearer to me just how much of our economy is based on extracting rents from friction.
Both big business and big labor depend on it. Freer markets drive down the cost of goods as new entrants undercut incumbents. A freer market is very threatening to existing businesses, and I wouldn’t want it any other way.

  Every time I get out of NYC, I am reminded at what we put up with to live here. It’s a known trope: we deal with sh*t that suburbanites couldn’t imagine, in exchange for being around amazing people (and companies, and $$).
There are three basic elements to living, and it is in these areas that NYC residents fare worse than middle-class suburbs. Fix these fundamentals, and quality of life ramps up.

  I agree with Clay Johnson that the our industry’s ignorance of Congress might be greater than Congress’ ignorance of the Internet. He comes to the conclusion that we need to lobby more.
I disagree. Throwing money down the lobby hole starts a vicious circle. We pay to play, and Congress finds new ways to milk the cow — or to create problems that justify their existence. As Clay Shirky put it: Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.
