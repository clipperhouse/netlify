  …can be entirely described in these four dimensions:
 Cache: The browser is a cache for a web page, whose canonical version lives on a server. A web page is a cache for structured data, whose canonical version lives in (say) SQL. Structured data is a cache for bits that live on a spinning piece of rust. The questions for the programmer are, how similar is a piece of data to its canonical source, and how similar does it have to be?

  You may notice in some situations, when using jQuery’s slideDown(), that the last little bit of the animation “jumps”. It feel un-smooth and frustrates those who like to dot our i’s. (Here an explanation.)
The main issue is that the browser (and thus jQuery) is uncertain about the height of the element that is sliding. This, in turn, is based on uncertainty about the _width_ — the width determines how lines wrap, and dictates the height.

  I am quite partial to ASP.net MVC and C#. I’ve played with other platforms, esp Ruby, which have appeal as well.
While many aspects of the platform are, imho, technologically ahead of its competition (LINQ, Intellisense and Razor), I can’t shake the feeling that MS still appeals primarily to those with an enterprise background. Which is to say, the cool kids are choosing Rails and doing their editing on a Mac.

  The headline say most of it. Google’s Chrome browser popped up over 10% market share for January. Modern browsers* are creeping up to around 80% market share, which means the user experience of the web is moving forward.
Something I hadn’t noticed previous: Internet Explorer 7 has substantially less market share than its predecessor, IE 6. So, when a site decides not to support IE 6, their justification for supporting IE 7 is even less.

  Gogo, which offers in-flight Wi-fi on a bunch of airlines, is now offering Facebook at no charge — but access to other sites will cost $$.
This violates net neutrality, no? Obviously, certain content is getting special treatment by an ISP, while other content is being blocked unless you pay up.
Am I being facetious? Not really. Discriminatory pricing is generally pro-consumer when you look into it. Different prices for different products usually translates to discounts, not price increases.

  Computer screens have not changed much over the last 20 years, relative to other technologies like processing power and bandwidth. Yes, panels are better in many ways in terms of color accuracy and “resolution”. But most applications are designed around an assumption of 72 or 96 pixels per inch.
I put “resolution” in quotes because, while screens have inched up in absolute pixels-per-inch, we are not using those pixels effectively.

  There are some stories making the rounds that “the Internet” is a public commons built on private property. This is wrong.
Firstly, is nothing public about it. “The Internet”, as we know is, exists and is useful because it is private. Or, more precisely, it is a lot of private entities working together because they choose to.
Those private entities include the corporations that provide the infrastructure and services (ISP’s like Comcast and services like Google).

  I received a pair of earmuffs today via Amazon Prime. Great service! They got to New York in just two days, all the way from a Nevada warehouse.
I feel bad, though. Clearly, by my paying extra for this service, I’ve moved others into Amazon’s slow lane. For that, I apologize.
I downloaded a new Justin Bieber Gnarls Barkley track on iTunes just now. It took seconds! Being curious sort, I discovered that Apple is paying a company called Akamai to store the file nearby so I can get it quickly.

  I am not a religious person. I also happen to believe that religious people bear the brunt of more everyday bigotry than most groups.
I have heard maybe two or three clearly racists sentiments in my life. By which I mean, uttered in my presence. I hear a similar number of slights against religious people every week, probably.
So upon reading Ricky Gervais’ explanation of his atheism, I had to cringe at his understanding of religion.

  Bernanke: “The Federal Reserve cannot solve all the economy’s problems on its own. That will take time and the combined efforts of many parties, including the central bank, Congress, the administration, regulators and the private sector.”
Note the order in which he ranks participants in the economy.
