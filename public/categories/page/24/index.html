  Joshua Topolsky offers a very funny and insightful take on the iPhone’s very fundamental flaw: it is designed for doing one thing at a time. […] my work requires that I use a bunch of web tools, look at lots of news sites, and have a feed reader open… basically, things that would require some level of multitasking. Imagine the frustration of having to constantly break the connection in chat to go look at a site or work on a post.

  An excellent and exhaustive survey of Wolfram Alpha by Mencius Moldbug. I think he thinks like I do: an engineer that looks at user interface analytically.
That’s not as bad as it sounds. I have no visual design abilities myself, yet I know something about interface. It has to do with expectations.
MM’s critique is that Wolfram Alpha is a great tool with a fundamental mistake in its interface. The mistake is that it makes a promise it can’t achieve: For serious UI geeks, one way to see an intelligent control interface is as a false affordance — like a knob that cannot be turned, or a chair that cannot be sat in.

  Google’s search market share in Europe is over 80%. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer — the target of repeated anti-trust charges by the EU — hovers under 50% in Europe.
By creating an operating system, it seems that Google is doing what monopolists are prohibited from doing: extending its dominance from one market to another. (Of course, Google’s new OS doesn’t exist yet and won’t have substantial market share for several years.

  Google has pre-announced the “Google Chrome OS”. It’s intended as a lightweight operating system built primarily for hosting a browser.
The post is short on specifics, mostly mentioning goals. I think it sounds very attractive — I only write web apps these days and know very few people who don’t. But will it get traction?
I think out of the gate, it will be slow going. After all, if you (as a user) want to live on the web, you have that ability now.

  So, my previous bit on the attraction of shortening one’s own URLs seems to have some traction. Obviously it wasn’t original to me, but I see that sites like Ars Technica and Flickr have begun doing their own URL shortening. Check it out:
http://arst.ch/4fj
I had a similar notion a few weeks ago. In addition to shortening one’s own URLs, one might even use a shorter domain name that evokes the full name.

  Identity theft boggles my mind a bit. It’s no mystery why criminal enterprises attempt it. It’s a mystery that we have systems where public information is used for security.
The biggest one is your Social Security Number. Why should knowledge of a person’s SSN entitle you to anything? The SSN is a user ID. A public key at best. It is certainly not a password.
And yet we use it as such.

  Ah, nothing gets international rivalry boiling like soccer football and the metric system. One wonders why the metric system hasn’t taken off here in the US. I posit this: it doesn’t offer any advantage to end users, ie, regular citizens. Let’s do the use case.
Proponents of the metric system argue that it’s utterly logical. And it is; everything is decimal (base 10), so we can easily convert from grams to kilograms.

  Raena Jackson Armitage offers an interesting exploration of LessCSS: I have a confession: I think parts of CSS suck. It’s repetitive, tedious, and … well, kind of dumb.
(Here are my previous comments.)
I wonder what it would take to work LESS into the CSS standard? The syntax seems intuitive and unambiguous, and feels like CSS. It’s a small evolution that would make a lot of people happy. I suspect the standards process is not so nimble.

  I am not sure I’ve ever used the term “cyber” for anything, ever, but that’s the name given to those who squat on domain names. Here’s my story.
I am working on a startup and we are working to choose a name. We are lucky enough to have a friend who does naming professionally — that’s right — and she gave us a brainstormed list of 80+ possibilities. We picked our favorites and began polling our friends on their impressions.
