			<h1>Internet diversity &amp; cut cables</h1>

				<h3 id="internet-diversity-amp-cut-cables">Internet diversity &amp; cut cables</h3>
<p>Following on to my previous post that <a href="http://richvsreach.com/2008/02/01/what-we-have-are-multiple-broadband-strategies-this-is-a-good-thing/">multiple broadband strategies</a> are better than a single one, we’ve been hearing quite a bit about <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/02/who_cut_the_cab.php">cut cables</a> in the Middle East and India. While not perfectly analagous to our domestic infrastructure, these events point out a fundamental quality of the Internet: diversity.</p>
<p>While it’s easy to suppose that a “national broadband strategy” is desirable, in fact it is likely to make the Internet less diverse in terms of infrastructure. If such a strategy allows Congress and the FCC to define the rules by which networks are built — effectively picking winners and losers — we are likely to end up with fewer providers and fewer technologies in play, and thus less ability to route around damage.</p>
<p>Have a look at our military procurement process, or agricultural subsidies. Tim Lee reminds us of the <a href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/043314.php">cartelization of railroads</a> in a previous century. Each of these examples put the power of an entire industry in the hands of a politically-connected few, via well-intended “national strategies”.</p>
<p>The Internet, by design, is about diversity and redundancy at a deep level. Seems to me the best way to maximize the Internet’s potential is to maximize these characteristics.</p>
