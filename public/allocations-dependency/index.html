			<h1>Allocations are a dependency</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I like to reduce or eliminate allocations in <a href="https://github.com/clipperhouse">my projects</a>,
which use garbage-collected languages (Go and C#). Like you, I want efficiency &ndash;
both in CPU cycles and memory.</p>
<p>But we should also understand allocations as taking a dependency on other systems.
As such, eliminating allocations is also an improvement in reliability.</p>
<p>First, by allocating, we take a dependency on the garbage collector. Modern
GCs are great! But they are complex systems in themselves. When we remove
them from our code paths, we eliminate a class of complexity. We also become
less-noisy neighbors to other dependents of that shared system.</p>
<p>The second dependency is the OS, which provides the memory. Also
a complex system! If we can avoid that system call, we bypass yet
another code path, and again are kind to our neighbors.</p>
<p>Our apps get big over time. If you&rsquo;ve ever handled an escalation or an outage
(who hasn&rsquo;t?), you learn that our ability to predict the behavior of our systems
is the definition of reliability. To the extent we can take a variable out of
the equation, we and our users benefit.</p>
