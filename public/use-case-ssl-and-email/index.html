			<h1>Use case: SSL and email</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Interesting article in the NYT about <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/16/gmail-to-get-more-protection-from-snoops/">using SSL for email</a>. It’s an option for Gmail which I turned on some time ago.</p>
<p>Eric Schmidt mentions that the (potential) downside of SSL is performance — your computer and the email service need to encrypt and decrypt data for every operation. That’s work. But does it matter to humans?</p>
<p>Let’s do the use case: how do we use email? Of all the applications we use on the internet, I would argue that email is the <strong>least real-time of all of them</strong>.</p>
<p>Email is pretty much the only electronic medium that a user does not actively wait for. When you click to a web page, you are waiting for something to happen. Same for voice and video and instant messaging. Small performance degradations can be felt very intuitively at human scale.</p>
<p>Not so with email. You won’t know if it takes an extra 5 or 30 seconds for a message to come in. This is because user has <strong>no expectation of a message until after it has arrived</strong>. So it always feels “fast”.</p>
<p>(This is why Blackberry was very successful even when it went over a dog-slow paging network.)</p>
<p>It’s almost like ignorance is bliss: if you knew that a message has been sent then you might feel like it’s taking a while. But that only ever happens if you are simultaneously communicating with a person over a more real-time medium.</p>
<p>Therefore, enabling SSL for email seems an obvious choice: improved security without the user perceiving any difference whatsoever.</p>
