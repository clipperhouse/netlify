			<h1>KPIs are software</h1>
			<div>
				<p>It’s easy to think of key performance indicators as a task to be tacked on to the end of a project. Rather, KPIs should be understood as a product like any other, and so:</p>
<h3 id="they-need-strategy">…they need strategy</h3>
<p>The person responsible for a product’s strategy will have specific hypotheses about what numbers they want to move. Key <em>entities and concepts</em> are described, as they will influence everything that follows.</p>
<h3 id="they-need-discovery">…they need discovery</h3>
<p>This is where the PM is responsible for choosing the right KPIs, i.e., building the right thing. Good KPIs clearly map back to strategy, like any feature. A metric that is interesting, but doesn’t map clearly back to strategy, is not a KPI.</p>
<h3 id="they-need-functional-specs">…they need functional specs</h3>
<p>A KPI needs a functional spec that is good enough for a developer to implement. It will describe concepts that exist in the world (users, profiles, jobs) and will not mention implementation details such as tables or columns.</p>
<h3 id="they-need-technical-specs">….they need technical specs</h3>
<p>The technical spec describes implementation details, and will illuminate where we need to collect more data or change our data model. (If you’ve ever tried to measure a metric, only to discover that we didn’t structure the data correctly, this will resonate.)</p>
<h3 id="they-have-a-user-experience">…they have a user experience</h3>
<p>This is a big one. If a KPI isn’t widely usable, then it’s a tree falling in a forest. The KPI’s interface needs to drive engagement. It needs a designer.</p>
<h3 id="they-need-a-schedule">…they need a schedule</h3>
<p>KPI development takes more than zero hours. Plan for it.</p>
<h3 id="they-need-engagement">…they need engagement</h3>
<p>We need to measure how KPIs are used. We’ve built lots of lonely dashboard and forgotten queries.</p>
<p>After building a KPI, we ask: How many uniques are viewing this KPI? How many times a month? How many returning users?</p>
