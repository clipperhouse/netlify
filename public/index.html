		<h2>Designing a composable rate limiter</h2>
		<p>
			Having used rate limiters a few times, I‚Äôve observed that they must be thoughtfully designed. In particular, they are typically comprised of several policies which we wish to stack on one another. It can get messy.

		<h2>The surprises of CDC on production workloads</h2>
		<p>
			 Motivated by this Twitter post by Craig Kerstiens
CDC (change data capture) tends to surprise in terms of expense on the production database. Each write becomes two writes ‚Äî once to the system of record, and once to the changefeed.

		<h2>Go-style ‚Äúalongside‚Äù testing in C# and .Net Core</h2>
		<p>
			I move between Go and C#, and one idiom I like in Go is tests living alongside the things they are testing, right in the same project. In addition to style preference, it (IMHO) more easily allows testing internal functions. In the .Net world, having a separate test project is traditional.
