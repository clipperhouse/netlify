			<h1>Somewhere in Brussels, some buggy whips need gilding</h1>
			<div>
				<p>One might think we live in feudal times, what with an unelected bureaucrat being able to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/28/microsoft-the-eus-atm-machine/">tax companies arbitrarily and retroactively</a>. However, since it’s an “anti-trust” issue, the European Commission gets around calling it a tax or tariff, and thus can charge whatever the Commission decides. There is no rate schedule to adhere to, no <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact5_e.htm">trade agreements</a> to abide. Didn’t we get past this kind of thing hundreds of years ago?</p>
<p>Obviously, this sort of fine does not improve the software market in Europe, any more than the EC’s decision to force Microsoft to sell a hobbled version of Windows, which <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/microsoft.ars/2005/11/20/1883">no one bought</a>. And why would they? The EC has little accountability to consumers (read: citizens) and thus has very little idea what they want.</p>
<p>One is only left with the conclusion that the point of such punishment is self-enrichment for the EC, distraction away from a sclerotic European software industry, and self-aggrandizement for individual bureaucrats.</p>
<p>What to do next for Microsoft? I’ve seen plenty of comments that say they should withdraw from the European market, etc. I understand the instinct, but it would be self-defeating.</p>
<p>Instead, Microsoft should double down and market the hell out of its products in Europe. In other words, go straight to the people. This would offer two upsides: first, more revenue to make up for the fines. And second, to show the bureaucrats how little they know about what’s best for their citizens.</p>
