			<h1>Will Microsoft “subsidize” Zune HD pricing?</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Microsoft announced <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125017417702129259.html?mod=djemTECH">pricing for its upcoming Zune HD</a> today, coming around 25% below the prices of equivalent iPod Touches. I wondered if Microsoft is making any money at such prices — after all, it’s based on a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2009/08/nvidia-tegra-is-ready-for-its-close-up-with-zune-hd-launch.ars">fancy new chip</a> and has other nice specs.</p>
<p>Then it occurred to me that perhaps Microsoft has room to lose money on the hardware. If customers buy the Zune subscription music service, MS will be taking in around $15/mo after the initial sale.</p>
<p>This is not unlike how AT&amp;T subsidizes the iPhone. Apple couldn’t afford to sell the iPhone at $99/$199 and expect to make money. But AT&amp;T will happily make up the difference, since they will receive an additional $60–100/mo on the device for the next two years.</p>
<p>Ditto the Xbox. Microsoft sells the hardware at a loss and makes money on games and other licensing.</p>
<p>So, due to its subscription service, the Zune can undercut Apple’s pricing considerably and get away with it.</p>
