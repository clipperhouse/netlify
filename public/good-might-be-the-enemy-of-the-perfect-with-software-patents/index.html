			<h1>The good might be the enemy of the perfect with software patents</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I have a few concerns, relating to unintended consequences, with a proposed <a href="//arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/bill-would-force-patent-trolls-to-pay-defendants-legal-bills/">loser-pays bill</a> on software patents.</p>
<p>I quite like the idea of loser-pays, and it is the standard in many parts of the world. And I certainly don’t like the current state of affairs with software patents. But the intended narrowness of the bill may make things worse.</p>
<p>Firstly, it attempts to define a software patent as anything that might be implemented on a computer. But think about the ideas that might be “implemented” on a computer. Any process, any design for a device. Such ambiguity tells me that litigation will in fact become more involved, and therefore more expensive, in arguing this point.</p>
<p>Remember, my (shall we say) skepticism about regulation comes from the fact that law is, above all else, <a href="/law-is-not-turing-complete/">gameable</a>. Regulation does not serve as rules of the road, as one hopes. Rather, it is one more input into a complex system.</p>
<p>My second bit of concern about this bill is that it is based on the standard that the “patent did not have a reasonable likelihood of succeeding”. If that’s the case, why was the case heard in the first place? The case succeeds, or it doesn’t.</p>
<p>To retrospectively claim it never had a chance is a bit of revisionist epistemology. And a great bit of ambiguity that begs for appeal.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps I am naive in that these sorts of standards are common in lawmaking. And perhaps I am too demanding that we have a perfect law instead of one that claims to move the ball some distance forward.</p>
<p>I can’t help but think that an increase in ambiguity is a favor to litigants. A better law would a) not attempt to define a software patent and b) apply a clear loser-pays standard to all patent litigation.</p>
<p>Laws are standards. Here’s why we keep making more:</p>
