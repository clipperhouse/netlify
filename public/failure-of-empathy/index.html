			<h1>A failure of empathy</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Consider for a moment the logic of the leading paragraph of <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/healthy-labels-not-stealthy-labels/?hp">this article</a>:
Research suggests that consumers spend only about one second looking at nutrition information when making myriad choices. A parent dashing through the grocery store aisles with kids in tow has to decide, in that one second, which is better: Triscuit vs. Saltines vs. Wheat Thins vs. Ritz? This is why Americans need a simple, standardized and truthful label on the front of all packaged foods.</p>
<p>This puts empiricism on its head. Labels have failed, ergo, we need more labels.</p>
<p>The evidence says nutrition information is not relevant to most people. The logical conclusion is, ok, we’ve learned something about people’s values and should proceed with this new information.</p>
<p>The empathetic response would be: humans have made their feelings known, let’s cater our policies toward their demonstrated behavior.</p>
<p>The less empathetic response: to be informed, but to make choices different than mine, is logically impossible. Thus, the only explanation is that they are uninformed.</p>
<p>This is the writer’s position. What has escaped his attention are myriad possibilities for human motivation. To ignore these possibilities is simple ignorance and lack of imagination. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>They’ve read the label before and understood it just fine. It wasn’t salient then, and it’s not now.</li>
<li>People’s choices on <em>everything</em> — food, mates, work — are about 90% emotional.</li>
<li>Pleasure is more interesting to most people.</li>
<li>Attention is expensive, and there is no tangible payoff for seeking a product with 20 fewer calories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these things is a personal choice — we balance pleasure vs. health every day. If you don’t go the gym tonight, you’re making such a trade-off. Does this mean you are uninformed?</p>
<p>The great lie comes in the final paragraph:
I want my Häagen-Dazs to tell me how many calories I am consuming — up front.</p>
<p><strong>If one is considering ice cream, then calories are, objectively, not driving one’s decision.</strong> He lacks empathy even with himself.</p>
