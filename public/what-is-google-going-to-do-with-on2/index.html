			<h1>What is Google going to do with On2?</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Google recently acquired On2, a company that creates video codecs, most notably for Flash (which is used on the most popular video sites). Dan Rayburn runs down and debunks a <a href="http://blog.streamingmedia.com/the_business_of_online_vi/2009/08/debunking-some-more-myths-of-the-googleon2-deal.html">number of theories</a> as to what Google has in mind. Rightly, he says that none are obviously correct.</p>
<p>(Side note, I’ve used On2’s Flix products for some time.)</p>
<p>I don’t think Google has an immediate tactical goal with the acquisition. They are delivering video just fine without owning the technology.</p>
<p>But that may be the point. Google didn’t need to create a web browser either — but by having one, they ensure some control over the direction of the technology. There will always be a browser that serves their needs, if the other players can’t be controlled.</p>
<p>With the On2 purchase, Google is putting itself in a similar position. They can ensure that Flash video will not be snuffed by Apple or Microsoft, or dictated by Adobe.</p>
<p>It’s one more piece of the (client) platform over which they have control. Google didn’t own a video technology that runs on your computer; now they do. <strong>Perhaps a Google Media Player is not far off?</strong></p>
<p>Another tactical thought: this is a chess move in preparation for an acquisition of Adobe. (Adobe has not just Flash but PDF too.) You <em>know</em> Apple has thought about acquiring Adobe for years. By owning some of the main codecs underlying Flash, Google controls a bit of Adobe’s destiny — making Apple’s would-be takeover that much harder. $100M is damn cheap for that bit of leverage.</p>
