			<h1>What we have are multiple broadband strategies; this is a good thing</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Over at Ars, the normally reasonable Nate <a href="//arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080131-we-have-a-broadband-strategy-bush-administration-says-yes.html">misses the point</a> on a national broadband strategy. He despairs over the fact that “we”, meaning the government, have no broadband strategy.</p>
<p>Actually, in the US, we have numerous broadband strategies. Verizon’s strategy is fiber to the home. AT&amp;T’s strategy is fiber to the node. Comcast’s strategy is DOCSIS 3.0. Sprint’s strategy is WiMax.</p>
<p>Each of these strategies is backed by highly incentivized companies, risking their own capital — not taxpayer’s. Each strategy will have varying levels of success, with various market segments, at various times.</p>
<p>For example, Verizon has fiber available to over 6 million homes, and is adding availability at around <a href="//www.cable360.net/wireless/21832.html">400,000 new homes per month</a> at the end of last year. What government is doing that?</p>
<p>What we don’t have is a Congressionally-mandated, FCC-managed, taxpayer-funded broadband strategy, and for that we should be thankful.</p>
<p>Nate also feels the need to repeat the <a href="//arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080131-fixing-us-broadband-100-billion-for-fiber-to-every-home.html">canard</a> about advertised bandwidth around the world. <em>Advertised?</em> Jeez louise, I thought we were talking about broadband, not marketing copy.</p>
<p>I recommend that interested readers head over to speedtest.net to see actual measured throughput around the world. Here is a <a href="//speedtest.net/global.php">sample</a>:</p>
