			<h1>Netbooks and computer theft</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I am sitting in a cafe and a woman is impressed that “this is the kind of place where people leave their computers unattended”, which I guess is true. With the coming <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001318.html">age of the netbook</a>, let’s look at the economics of crime.</p>
<p>The what? Yes, the interesting thing here is what happens when a product becomes commoditized, which I define as “cheap enough for just about everyone”. I contend that the emergence of netbooks will essentially end computer theft.</p>
<p>So why would someone steal a computer?</p>
<ul>
<li>To use it themselves</li>
<li>To sell it for money</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s say the average computer costs $2000, and that a would-be thief considers stealing one for themselves. The thief makes a bet: if I win, I am $2000 ahead. If I lose, I am in jail.</p>
<p>If computers average closer to $500, then the upside of stealing is cut by 75%. Imagine if your odds at the craps table just got 75% worse — do you stay in the game? A rational thief would leave the market.</p>
<p>Now, if the thief were hoping to fence the stolen computer, similar dynamics apply. They can no longer get $2000 for the stolen goods. And, because netbooks are cheap, everyone already has one. The market for the thief’s product has dried up.</p>
