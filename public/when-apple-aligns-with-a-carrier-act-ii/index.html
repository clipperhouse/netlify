  <p>Apple is not really a partnering company. They make their own hardware and software — and services like .Mac Mobile Me — to ensure a certain user experience. This is their offer, and it works.</p>

<p>When Apple partnered with AT&amp;T to release the iPhone, this was an unusual ceding of control on Apple’s part. They couldn’t build a phone network, of course, and that business is probably a bit old-school and low-margin for stylie Apple.</p>

<p>But they made it work, and they learned something (I know, I know, insert AT&amp;T bitching here).</p>

<p>So as I am browsing my buddy’s cool FIOS, I gotta wonder when Apple is gonna make a move to take over set-top boxes, partnering with one of the big TV providers (Comcast, Time Warner, Verizon, AT&amp;T…).</p>

<p>The AppleTV ain’t it. But perhaps it’s a research project leading toward the above.</p>

<p>The analogy to the iPhone is clear. Before the iPhone, phones worked. But they were harder than they needed to be. And they didn’t work like computers; software updates were rare and apps were crude.</p>

<p>The iPhone puts phones on the rapid iteration (refinement) cycle that we’ve come to expect on PCs.</p>

<p>So as I look at the kludgy FIOS interface here, I see a hundred little places it could be improved. It’s connected to a fat piece of fiber. But I suspect that it will look exactly the same in a year.</p>

<p>When and if the cable TV industry gets competitive — and it’s happening it fits and starts — we’ll see them fighting for the consumer via the set-top box. Watch for Apple to step in.</p>
