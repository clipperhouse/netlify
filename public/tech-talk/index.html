<p>The world of technology can be overwhelming — so much jargon and an ever-changing landscape.</p>
<p>If you’re in a technical field, <strong>knowledge and credibility</strong> matter a lot; leveling-up one’s understanding makes one more competitive.</p>
<p><a href="/about/">Matt Sherman</a> specializes in explaining this landscape to folks in non-technical roles, especially  recruiting and sales.</p>
<h2 id="whirlwind-tour">Whirlwind tour</h2>
<p>Matt offers an introductory tour to get a handle on technology jargon and ecosystems. We cover such questions as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do programmers do exactly?</li>
<li>Why are there so many programming languages?</li>
<li>What is Java? Is it the same as JavaScript?</li>
<li>What is ‘front-end’ vs ‘back-end’?</li>
<li>What is a database?</li>
<li>What do data scientists do?</li>
<li>What is devops?</li>
</ul>
<p>This interactive session takes around an hour, and is customized for the audience. It is intended to be conversational, with lots of detours for audience questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/oGWGzkEHnQU">Here’s a preview.</a></p>
<h2 id="tech-recruiting-boot-camp">Tech recruiting boot camp</h2>
<p>You’ve been asked to hire technical people: engineers, data scientists, systems administrators. It’s a challenging task in a competitive market.</p>
<p>Matt will work with you to understand the technical talent landscape, to improve your credibility with candidates. We’ll develop your strategies for attracting the right applicants.</p>
<h2 id="job-listings-workshop">Job listings workshop</h2>
<p>The job listing is the first thing a candidate will see. It needs to be accurate, informative and to the point.</p>
<p>What are the elements of a job listing that will appeal to an engineer? How to stand out from other job listings? Matt will work with you to speak credibly to your target audience, clearing out the boilerplate, and focusing on what candidates will respond to.</p>
<h2 id="resume-review">Resume review</h2>
<p>Evaluating a technical resume is difficult and time-consuming. Matt will work with you to systematically identify promising candidates, to improve the conversion rate of your hiring funnel, and to keep hiring managers happy.</p>
