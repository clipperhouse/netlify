			<h1>The more interesting game</h1>
			<div>
				<p>At Stack, I play a lot of ping pong with my coworkers. I win with some regularity, but my technique is not especially aggressive, or even correct.</p>
<p>I’ll use spins when they aren’t called for. I’ll pause to let a ball nearly hit the floor before sending it back into play. I’ll lob when I should slam.</p>
<p>I optimize my games for entertainment, not winning. I prefer the interesting game over the optimal one.</p>
<p>Some of my competitors find this irritating, and rightly so. Breaking, say, blackjack protocol will cause ire around the table, and for those trying to play a serious game of ping pong, the analogy holds.</p>
<p>But here’s the irony bit: this f*cking around makes me a better player. Why I lack in practice and discipline, I make up for in discovery.</p>
<p>By asking “I wonder if this will work”, I learn a lot about the possibilities, and I do so perhaps more quickly than if I approached the game with a more student-like discipline.</p>
<p>Experiment is higher-bandwidth learning, for me. Canon is rich and important, but for a learner like me, it’s narrowband.</p>
<p>Canon is de facto a priori.</p>
<p>My technique sucks, but I win, because I learn more.</p>
<p>So when I say I optimize</p>
