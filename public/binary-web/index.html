  <p>It’s easy to see the web as sets of advances that come in waves. The first was its emergence as a consumer (and corporate) phenomenon, starting with Netscape and continuing through Internet Explorer 6 (which, we often forget, was the first “legitimate” browser for many businesses).</p>

<p>The second wave was Ajax and broadband. This combination allowed web sites to act less like pages and more like applications — responsive enough for things like email. Javascript came of age.</p>

<p>Even at that second milestone, however, the web as an application platform was still behind most desktop apps. I began my professional career on Filemaker, and its capabilities weren’t matched by web sites for a decade or more.</p>

<p>The main limitation, in my opinion, was markup + styles as the interface language. HTML and CSS are a complex of interacting and highly dependent rules. Any change to the DOM requires a recalculation of the layout. Small operations compel the browser runtime to do work that is disproportionate to the size of the change.</p>

<p>(Of course there are optimizations to be had, and browsers are amazing from this perspective.)</p>

<p>We are experiencing the third wave now, which I will call “the binary web”. Three technologies in particular — Canvas, WebGL and sockets — are the next big step forward. What these have in common is the ability to do truly granular operations.</p>

<p>These technologies replace a world of markup and bytes with one of pixels and bits. WebGL and Canvas allow pixels to be changed without reflowing a document; witness the frame rates of web pages that use these technologies.</p>

<p>Similarly, web sockets free us from the expense of the HTTP request-response cycle; the data-to-overhead ratio is greatly improved. (And the “server push” promised in the 90’s finally arrives.)</p>

<p>In other words, these technologies make the web computationally cheaper, perhaps by an order of magnitude. It’s a matter of economics more than technology. Think of it as Moore’s Law for the browser.</p>
