			<h1>The legacy ad industry is wrong about ad blockers</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I was recently directed to a couple of papers on browser ad-blocking software (<a href="http://downloads.pagefair.com/reports/adblocking_goes_mainstream_2014_report.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://downloads.pagefair.com/reports/the_rise_of_adblocking.pdf">here</a>). They are not so much alarmist as they are self-serving and hindered by status quo bias.</p>
<p>Ad blockers remind me of music piracy since the advent of Napster. The technical details are different, but the dynamic is the same — a consumer gets what they want at a lower price, through technical means.</p>
<p>Then, as now, few users thought of themselves as violating any rights. They simply used a product they liked. And if their friend turns them on to a tool that makes it better or cheaper, great.</p>
<p>Then, as now, one could make the not-illegitimate argument that one is stealing or in some way depriving a creative artist or organization of revenue. Those accustomed to making a living in the field call their customers <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=ethics%20of%20ad%20blocking">immoral</a>. They predict the decline of product as we starve it of revenue.</p>
<p>Plausible! But wrong. The argument is as impotent as it was 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Ad blocking, like music piracy, is best understood as a market phenomenon. A class of users prefers that experience over the more “expensive” one.</p>
<p>Market data seems like an opportunity to make a better product.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs recognized this, and responded with iTunes. A better product that competed against piracy. (It also competed with the legacy model of album sales.)</p>
<p>Today, Medium.com is positioned as Apple was with music piracy. They see ads as making a <a href="http://clipperhouse.com/2014/02/18/threshold-thinking/">worse product</a>. So they are trying to make a better one.</p>
<p>They sell transparent <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/29/medium-shows-off-bmw-as-its-first-collections-sponsor-as-it-dives-into-paid-content/">sponsorships</a> that respect the user, so it’s not like they are against making money. Rather, it’s a more evolved product shaped by user preference.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>By the way, the record companies weren’t wrong. They shrank a lot. They were indeed threatened by piracy and by Apple’s decoupling of songs from albums.</p>
<p>But it’s not like music has suffered. It’s as good or better than it’s ever been. Production quality and distribution are great. More people hear more songs.</p>
<p>Remember, the “good old days” of profitable record-making worked for maybe 1% of artists. It was not a halcyon. It was high barriers to entry and a power law that favored few.</p>
<p>Maybe we’ve shaved some profit from middlemen. But consumer surplus has increased. Which seems like economic progress, no?</p>
