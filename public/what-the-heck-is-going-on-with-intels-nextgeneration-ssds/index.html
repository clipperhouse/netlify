			<h1>What the heck is going on with Intel’s next-generation SSDs?</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Intel first <a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20090721comp.htm">announced</a> its second generation consumer solid-state drives on July 21. There were plenty of positive reviews at the time, and the price drop combined with better performance made me ready to take the plunge.</p>
<p>A few days later, a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/07/27/bios-password-snag-subdues-intels-34mn-x25-m-g2-launch-party/">defect</a> was found. Intel has historically done a good job of issuing patches, so I assumed that a firmware fix would not be a big deal. But then they disappeared from store shelves (by which I mean e-tailers like Amazon and NewEgg).</p>
<p>Now it’s mid-September, and it’s been very hard to find someone willing to ship one. I’ve seen prices on Amazon vary from $269 to over $400 for the 80G version (SSDSA2MH080G2). Such pricing volatility means they are having trouble knowing what the supply will be. And they are quoting a ship time of 2 to 4 weeks.</p>
<p>I think SSDs are a <a href="/blog/post/Whats-the-word.aspx">sea change</a> and will follow a cycle like that of LCDs a few years ago. So where the heck is Intel?</p>
