  <p>You watch a movie. In order to get something from it, you have to enter the world that it presents. You must suspend disbelief.</p>

<p>This is essential for the product to work correctly. If you are unwilling to believe, say, that space mercenaries have Wookiee friends, or that the bumbling Bluth family exists — then it’s very unlikely the product is for you.</p>

<p>Restated, you know full well that none of what you perceive actually exists, but you believe it in order to get something out of the experience.</p>

<p>And so it is with programming abstractions. It might be a language, like C#, or a framework, like jQuery. <strong>What they actually do is much less important than your perception of what they do.</strong></p>

<p>There is in fact no “integer” named “x” — but you operate as if it exists. You suspend disbelief. To do otherwise would be counterproductive.</p>

<p>It would puzzle me immensely if a person continues to watch a movie while insisting that Meryl Streep isn’t actually a nun or that there is no such thing as a warp core. Commit, or find another movie.</p>

<p>Similarly, it puzzles me when programmers choose an abstraction while being unwilling to adopt its mental model.</p>

<p>This usually expresses itself as poorly separated concerns: observables that try to look at their observers. Business logic that’s tied to a web server. Jamming arbitrary SQL into an ORM.</p>

<p>— -</p>

<p>I know your reaction: sometimes this is necessary. And you’re right! Abstractions can be leaky.</p>

<p>Indeed, films can be poorly made. There might be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owH54AiCheg">continuity errors</a>, or bad costumes. In which case the creator has failed to a degree, and broken your illusion.</p>

<p>But your choice is still: believe in Wookiees or find another movie. <strong>Each is reasonable, but not both.</strong></p>

<p>With a language or a framework, you have the same choice. The creator of the abstraction is offering you an illusion and a mental model to go with it.</p>

<p>If poor coding breaks the illusion, you might need to work around specific bugs. If the model is confusing, you might not think it worthwhile.</p>

<p>But if you adopt an abstraction, while enforcing a different mental model than the designer intended, I don’t get that. It’s like staying in the theater, but telling everyone within earshot that Robert DeNiro is not, in fact, a taxi driver.</p>

<p>Commit. Or find another movie.</p>
