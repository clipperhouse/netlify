			<h1>Principles of null-free programming</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Nulls are a notorious source of bugs in many programming languages. Here, I sketch out a way to avoid them, using C# for illustration.</p>
<p>To be clear, this post is intended as <strong>habits for human programmers</strong>; it is specifically <em>not</em> about static analysis or language features.</p>
<h4 id="principles">Principles</h4>
<p>I submit that we can avoid a large majority of null-related errors if we follow these two principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passing a null is a programming error</li>
<li>Branching on null is a programming error</li>
</ul>
<p>I think most of our problems trace back to imbuing null with meaning, i.e., we use it as a signal.</p>
<p>I submit that null is the <strong>absence of meaning</strong>. It is not a <em>de facto</em> Boolean describing existence. Rather, it should be treated non-deterministically.</p>
<p>This implies that <strong>most functions should not “handle” null</strong>. Because null is the absence of meaning, we can not use it to make a decision.</p>
<p>When a method receives a null, and throws, it should be interpreted as a <strong>bug in the caller</strong>. (Admirably, C#’s LINQ methods do this.)</p>
<h4 id="some-patterns">Some patterns</h4>
<p>One great way of avoiding null is to have a better definition of non-existence. For example, where we might be tempted to define non-existence as null, let’s define it as <strong>a collection of length zero</strong>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type">Option type</a> implementations often look like this.</p>
<p>In C#, “by ID” database calls will typically return null if such a record does not exist. In LINQ, it’s expressed as a FirstOrDefault or SingleOrDefault, which return null on “not found”. Or, one can call First or Single methods which throw on same. I consider both to be bad semantics.</p>
<p>Rather, consider a pattern based on an explicit Boolean for existence, and where <strong>null is not in our vocabulary</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>Thing t;  
if (!TryThingById(12345, out t)) {  
    return &quot;Sorry, not found!&quot;;  
} 
// …do as you wish with t, without worrying about null
</code></pre><p>The Try pseudocode would look something like:</p>
<pre><code>bool TryThingById(int id, out Thing t) {  
    var rows = DB.Query(&quot;select * from Things where ID = ?&quot;, id);  
    if (rows.Length == 0) {  
        return false; // t is indeed null but should be irrelevant  
    }  
    if (rows.Length == 1) {  
        t = rows[0];  
        return true;  
    }  
    throw; // there’s a database problem  
}
</code></pre><p>I believe this code follows our Principles above: we don’t pass a null, and we don’t branch on one either.</p>
<p>A common idiom in C# is to use <strong>optional parameters</strong>, with null as the default value:</p>
<pre><code>void Foo(int id, Bar bar = null, Baz baz = null)
</code></pre><p>When I see a method signature like this, I have $5 that says the method’s implementation branches on those parameters. Which means that parameters are no longer just values, but are control flow. Bad semantics.</p>
<p>Instead, consider creating several methods with good names, and which <strong>accept and require only the parameters they use</strong> – no more optionals. “Branching” is done via method resolution, about which we can more easily reason.</p>
<hr>
<p>What’s nice about the above code is that nulls are not mentioned, or even relevant. Of <em>course</em> a caller can do the wrong thing, but now the word “null” sticks out as a code smell.</p>
<p>Again, these are patterns for humans, not static guarantees. But now we can lint for strings like “null”, and have a good chance of catching errors.</p>
