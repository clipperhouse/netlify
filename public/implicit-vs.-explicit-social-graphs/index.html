			<h1>Implicit vs. explicit social graphs</h1>
			<div>
				<p>There are two kinds of social graphs in the world, explicit and implicit. The explicit ones are the most rare and give their owners disproportionate market values.</p>
<p>The two I am thinking of are Facebook (private market value around $40B) and LinkedIn, with a public market cap of ~$6B. What makes their graphs explicit is that two individuals <strong>deliberately and mutually describe</strong> their connection with one another.</p>
<p>Implicit “soft” graphs include Twitter and Google (via Gmail). In Twitter’s case, the opt-in is only one way; only one user declares interest in another, and it need not be reciprocated. Gmail’s graph is inferred from your behavior — they know with whom you’ve interacted, but <em>you</em> haven’t explicitly told Gmail about your relationship with a person.</p>
<p>Explicit graphs can be mined more easily, since they begin with hard data. As I’ve mentioned in the past, it’s <a href="http://clipperhouse.com/2009/08/30/it%E2%80%99s-the-data-not-the-algorithm/">data, not algorithms</a> that will be hard for competitors to replicate in the future.</p>
<p>So, explicit graphs should be understood as truly personal, and <em>social</em>. Implicit graphs should be understood as a compilation of our interests.</p>
<p>Knowing <em>what</em> we like is old science, going back to the advent of credit cards. <em>Who</em> we like is new information. Thus the valuations.</p>
