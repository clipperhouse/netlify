  Firefox is a fine browser. Really, the current release of any of the major browsers is very good.
Firefox is currently, and comfortably, the #2 browser in market share. A look at the competitive landscape makes me wonder, however, if they have an audience in the long term.
There are probably two kinds of web users — those who make deliberate decisions about browsers and those who don’t. I think both will have less reason to use FF as time goes on.

  I am developing a credit card authorization library which uses the WebClient class. In addition, I am using the excellent Fiddler to watch the requests and responses.
As you might expect, the credit card web service is HTTPS. Fiddler is acting as a proxy server on my dev machine.
Not surprisingly, WebClient throws an exception: “The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish secure channel for SSL/TLS”. As well it should — the SSL certificate in this case is not the one supplied by credit card authorizer.

  As I work on my ASP.net jQuery controls, I got to thinking about what “animations” really are. The core animation framework in jQuery (as far as I can tell) is to simply iterate in small steps between two CSS states. So if you are going from 0% opacity to 100% opacity, jQuery applies (say) 100 CSS changes in 1% increments.
This is essentially hammering the DOM. The browser is forced to make 100 updates to the state of an element, and re-render it, over a short period of time.

  Public Knowledge points out AT&amp;T’s new Terms which give different treatment to video based on its source. (No, it’s not neutral but of course, I think that’s fine.)
What right now looks like preferential economic treatment to an incumbent’s preferred bits is in fact setting the stage for putting such treatment up for sale. Mind you, the network won’t treat, say, iTunes’ actual bits any differently than anyone else’s. They’ll get delivered just like they are now.

  Time-Warner cable has begun to roll out its metered pricing plan in Beaumont, Texas. Alley Insider says it won’t work, and Mike Arrington declares it a moral outrage. Both are missing the “third way” which I wrote about earlier this year.
Tying consumers’ prices to their consumption is not inherently a bad thing — in fact, it’s probably good for network buildout. Relating usage to fees provides a return on investment: more bandwidth provided equals more revenue, thus more capacity equals more revenue.

  I would not have predicted this: The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should allow broadband providers to manage their networks and slow “bandwidth hogs,” despite concerns that such practices arbitrarily target some customers, said a coalition of seven civil rights groups.Net neutrality rules for broadband providers would protect bandwidth hogs at the expense of other customers and civic organizations, said the coalition, which includes the National Black Chamber of Commerce, Latinos in Information Sciences and Technology Association, League of Rural Voters, and National Council of Women’s Organizations.

  One might think we live in feudal times, what with an unelected bureaucrat being able to tax companies arbitrarily and retroactively. However, since it’s an “anti-trust” issue, the European Commission gets around calling it a tax or tariff, and thus can charge whatever the Commission decides. There is no rate schedule to adhere to, no trade agreements to abide. Didn’t we get past this kind of thing hundreds of years ago?

  Paul Buchheit, whom I’ve never read prior, has a very nice article about what makes a successful company: You can take the smartest, most experienced, most connected, most brilliant people in the world and have them build the most stunningly designed and technically advanced product in the world, but if people don’t want it, then you will fail.This is roughly what happened with the Segway, for example. […]Even if you aren’t the smartest person around, and your product is kind of ugly and broken, you can still be very successful, if you just build the right product.
