I have a confession: I think parts of CSS <em>suck.</em> It’s repetitive, tedious, and … well, kind of dumb.</p>

<p>(Here are my <a href="/blog/post/Imagine-CSS-evolved-as-a-programming-language.aspx">previous comments</a>.)</p>

<p>I wonder what it would take to work LESS into the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS standard</a>? The syntax seems intuitive and unambiguous, and feels like CSS. It’s a small evolution that would make a lot of people happy. I suspect the standards process is not so nimble. ;)</p>

<p>This presents an interesting case in standards versioning. CSS versions are mostly based around the addition of more sophisticated styles, but the syntax doesn’t change. So when a browser doesn’t support a particular CSS feature, it’s an incremental, cosmetic loss. It degrades gently. Since my above suggestion is a syntactic change, we must take more care as not to break things.</p>

<p>That said, I believe we can <strong>begin using the new syntax now</strong>. Here’s a straightforward, server-side backward- and forward-compatibility story.</p>

<p>On the .Net side, one would write an HttpHandler for “.less” files. For the current generation of browsers, the handler would parse the .less into standard CSS, as the Ruby-based <a href="http://github.com/cloudhead/less/tree/master">LESS compiler</a> does. For those browsers that support the new standard — whenever that might be — the handler would simply pass the .less code straightaway. (I am sure that an Apache mod would be similarly straightforward.)</p>

<p>We don’t need to wait for a standard — if the web community likes this idea, let’s make it a de facto standard and let the W3C catch up if they care to.</p>

<p>I’ll ask again — what enterprising .Net Ruby person is gonna implement this so I can start playing?</p>
