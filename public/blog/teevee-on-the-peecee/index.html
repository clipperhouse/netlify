<div class="post-content"><p>So I’ve moved to a new place in NYC, and it’s a bit…cozier…than what I was used to in San Francisco. So I am looking for ways to save space and for now I’ve decided to go without a TV.</p>

<p>I do <a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2008/01/26/28-not-having-a-tv/">like TV</a>, I admit. So am cobbling together a few ways to watch shows without paying for cable or buying another screen.</p>

<p>I’ve found that the state of television on the computer is still a bit DIY. I bought this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001DEYVXO?tag=clipperhouse-20&amp;amp;camp=213381&amp;amp;creative=390973&amp;amp;linkCode=as4&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B001DEYVXO&amp;amp;adid=117A6FGPWNDHAX5WVWND&amp;amp;">neat little HD tuner</a>, and it works great for over-the-air broadcasts. In NY, that gets me the major networks plus a handful of others. Used in conjunction with Windows Media Center, I get a decent experience on my regular 21” computer monitor. It does DVR too.</p>

<p>A bit of Netflix and a smattering of Hulu, plus (perhaps) some <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?id=323236719&amp;amp;s=143441">season subscriptions</a> on iTunes, and I am pretty well covered. This guy <a href="http://adamlindsay.posterous.com/why-i-canceled-time-warner-cable">runs down the costs</a> of going a la carte — I am probably saving $30–50 a month overall.</p>

<p>My next step will be to get something a bit more unified. But it’s surprising how computer makers don’t really offer the whole package.</p>

<p>For example, a 27” iMac would give me a good size screen and workhorse computer. But Apple — and most computer makers — don’t make it obvious how you might turn this into a TV replacement.</p>

<p>Dell is stepping in this direction with their new <a href="http://on10.net/blogs/sarahintampa/Dells-Zino-Line-Candy-Colored-Mini-Computers/">Zino</a>, a Mac Mini-esque wee little box that would fit well in a living room. They will have a TV tuner as a build option, I’ve read.</p>

<p>Windows Media Center is really quite nice. Nearly as good as Tivo and better than your cable box. Why isn’t Microsoft promoting it? Why aren’t the OEM’s selling a simple, inexpensive, minimally configurable machine that boots into WMC all the time?</p>
