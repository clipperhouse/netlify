    <main class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Much of the commentary I’ve seen for today’s <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/11/microsoft-announces-ten-windows-phone-7-handsets-for-30-countrie/">announcement</a> of Windows Phone 7 revolves around whether Microsoft can catch up with Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android. Fair enough; feature-wise, they are in the same ballpark.</p>

<p>But Microsoft need not triumph over the “big two” in terms of mindshare. In fact, Apple and Google aren’t the big two at all. Who is? Nokia and RIM.</p>

<p>Between them, their operating systems command around <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/03/18/the-mobile-os-market/">60% of the mobile market</a> — but this number falling rapidly. This fall is due to the uptake of app-driven smartphones. In other words, it’s raining customers for this segment of the market.</p>

<p>Microsoft isn’t really targeting Apple and Google, dollar-wise. They are looking at all the new customers coming in to the smartphone market. If they manage to get, say, 20% of the switchers, that’s millions of people.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I am told of a prediction that RIM’s market share will halve in the next few years — while selling twice and many phones. Get it?</p>

<p>Microsoft is going after those former RIM (and Nokia) customers. There will be a lot of them.</p>

<p>There’s the old story of the two campers who see a bear charging toward their camp. One camper sits down to put on his running shoes. The other asks if he’s crazy. He says no: I don’t need to outrun the bear. I just need to outrun <em>you</em>.</p>
