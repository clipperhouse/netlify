    <main class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>A very interesting <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/08/02/the_truth_about_grit/?page=full">study of the idea of “grit”</a>. It attempts to quantify personal characteristics than lead to success via perseverance.</p>

<p>I often wonder if I have it. I am willing to take risks which depend on my intelligence — I quit my job to start a startup. But I really fear that I’ve gotten soft.</p>

<p>I get bored easily; this is the opposite of grit. So perhaps those who have “grit” are the ones who have found a way to feel rewarded even when the work is boring.</p>

<p>What I also like about the idea is that the myth of the lone genius, who with a quick stroke can take over the world, is highly overrated. Those of us in Silicon Valley are quite invested in that myth. We see a lot of successful companies who seem to have succeeded on this principle.</p>

<p>Rather than toiling on an idea for years until it takes a life of its own, we see companies like Twitter which seem like small ideas that catch fire. And we see other companies who do amazing work but go nowhere.</p>

<p>I am quite skeptical that the overnight success stories are as they seem.</p>

<p>In many ways, sure, it’s better to be lucky than good. But I have also come to believe that a great idea has very limited value. It’s execution that counts.</p>

<p>I haven’t kept my startup idea very secret among those who know me. Even if someone “steals” it, I consider the likelihood that they will actually execute on it to be fairly small. So I do a cost/benefit: the feedback I get is probably more valuable than the cost (risk) of someone beating us to market.</p>

<p>Which is a way of saying, there are a small number of people with the “grit” to actually run with an idea. I hope I am one of them.</p>
