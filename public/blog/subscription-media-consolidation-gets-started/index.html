  <p>There are <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/13/rumor-amazon-wants-to-rent-netflix-and-never-return-it/">rumors</a> that Amazon is interested in buying Netflix. I like the idea, though it’s just one step toward the sort of <a href="/blog/post/Subscription-music-consolidation.aspx">subscription media consolidation</a> that I outlined a while ago.</p>

<p>What Netflix offers Amazon is a highly-regarded service and a substantial audience. This is also known as a brand.</p>

<p>What Amazon offers Netflix is scale and a future. While Netflix is king of the heap in the DVD rental business right now, their future as a streaming company is anything but assured. Such a transition will require massive investment in both infrastructure and brand — and there are a lot of people trying to claim the same market.</p>

<p>I see a three-horse race in the future of subscription media. There will be Apple (iPhonePod/iTunes), Microsoft (Zune/XBox) and a third company that is the consolidation of Amazon, Netflix, Pandora, Rhapsody and/or Tivo. The consolidated company will likely be called Amazon.</p>

<p>Possible spoilers/wildcards:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft scoops up Rhapsody</li>
<li>Legacy media jumps into the subscription business (via Hulu)</li>
</ul>
