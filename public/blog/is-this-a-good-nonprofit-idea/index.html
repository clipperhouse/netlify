  <p>So, an idea I have been kicking around a while is BillableHour.org. Would like to gather some feedback.</p>

<p>It’s a simple listing service for those who provide services that are billable by the hour. Such a person (or company) might be a lawyer, a programmer, or a gardener.</p>

<p><strong>The monthly fee for listing on the site is your hourly rate.</strong> The proceeds go to a variety of charities, probably voted on by participants.</p>

<p>Let’s assume the site gathers something of a halo, as a desirable place to be seen by these businesses. Here’s why I like linking the monthly fee to your hourly rate.</p>

<p><strong>It is self-regulating in terms of honesty of rates.</strong> If you want to pay less to be listed on the service, by quoting a low rate, you will be screwing yourself. You charge $90/hour but only want to pay us $50/month? Well, now you are quoting your would-be customer a too-low price.</p>

<p>Is this an interesting mechanism? What would it take to grow that halo? To reach a critical mass? Can this compete with other listing sites?</p>

<p>The reason I put “non-profit” in quotes is that I am skeptical of the sustainability of non-profits as organizations. I’d be tempted to run it as a for-profit company that happens to do a lot of charity, and is transparent.</p>

<p>Thanks for your thoughts.</p>
