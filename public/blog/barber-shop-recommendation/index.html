So, it was 90&#43; degrees in NY and I went for a run. I’ve never perspired that much in my life. On the walk back to where I was staying, I stopped in a barber shop and said “how much to take it off”?
$16. Wow, that’s cheap. The place did a proper job and even shaved my neck with a straight blade.
They’re called Reamir and apparently they have several locations in Manhattan." />

<p>So, it was 90+ degrees in NY and I went for a run. I’ve never perspired that much in my life. On the walk back to where I was staying, I stopped in a barber shop and said “how much to take it off”?</p>

<p>$16. Wow, that’s cheap. The place did a proper job and even shaved my neck with a straight blade.</p>

<p>They’re called <a href="http://www.reamir.com/">Reamir</a> and apparently they have several locations in Manhattan. I was at the one on 57th and 2nd.</p>

<p>And they’re very nice, closer to a stylist than a barber shop. They’re Uzbeki. They give <a href="http://www.derringermedia.com/images/reamir/image16.pdf">free cuts to veterans</a> [pdf] on Wednesdays. And apparently they hang out with <a href="http://www.reamir.com/page_info.php?pages_id=1?osCsid=8f192ec393cd07ddee6f4f1f6a7c2250">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>.</p>
