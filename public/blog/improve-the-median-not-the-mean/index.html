  <p>I like seeing Google Fiber prompt incumbent dinosaurs into <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/comcast-says-itll-bring-ultra-fast-internet-us-2016/">boosting speeds</a>. It’s great.</p>

<p>But: it doesn’t matter much. I have 10x the bandwidth at work (gigabit) than I do at home. I barely notice it, however, for both <a href="https://www.igvita.com/2012/07/19/latency-the-new-web-performance-bottleneck/">technical</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens%27_power_law">perceptual</a> reasons.</p>

<p>In fact, my home internet recently improved 3x from ~30mbps to its current ~100mbps. Maybe videos achieve HD a little more quickly? Maybe?</p>

<p>Point being, I had decent bandwidth for my use cases, and the new bandwidth — which I am <em>intellectually</em> thrilled about — offers diminishing returns of actual utility.</p>

<p>Because I already had above-average bandwidth, these improvements <strong>move the mean more than they move the median</strong>. This disparity offers a clue about utility.</p>

<p>There’s more bang for the buck in improving the lower percentiles of performance. Moving a substantial number of users from 1mbps to 10mbps is a greater increase in utility than my recent improvements.</p>

<p>Google has the <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2015/04/a-quic-update-on-googles-experimental.html">right idea</a> here with QUIC. It offers a substantial improvement for the worst 1% of latency, which nudges the median upward. Let’s focus on that.</p>
