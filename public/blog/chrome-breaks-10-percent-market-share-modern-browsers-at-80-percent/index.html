Google’s Chrome browser <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=1">popped up</a> over 10% market share for January. Modern browsers* are <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2">creeping up</a> to around 80% market share, which means the user experience of the web is moving forward.</p>

<p>Something I hadn’t noticed previous: Internet Explorer 7 has substantially less market share than its predecessor, IE 6. So, when a site decides not to support IE 6, their justification for supporting IE 7 is even less. (IE 8 is the market leader overall with 34%.)</p>

<p>The beta versions of IE 9 and Firefox 4 are neck-and-neck at 0.5% share.</p>

<ul>
<li>My casual definition of “modern browser” is any Chrome version, any Firefox version, and and IE version 8 or higher. I exclude browsers with less than 1% market share.</li>
