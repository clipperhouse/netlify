While they have quadrupled the pixel count (to 2880 x 1800), they have not increased real estate, per se.</p>

<p>In other words, the number of windows or characters or columns displayable on the screen has not changed — it is essentially a 1440 x 900 pixel display with increased sharpness. It’s like a new printer with a higher dpi, but the same paper size. Follow?</p>

<p>In an ideal word, where apps and web pages are defined in physical units like ems or inches, one could arbitrarily size applications up and down to one’s taste — true “resolution independence”. But we ain’t there, quite.</p>

<p>So I got to thinking if these new pixels could be exploited in a way that goes beyond aesthetics, a quasi-resolution-independence if you will.</p>

<p>During today’s <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/126pihbedvcoihbefvbhjkbvsefbg/event/index.html">keynote</a> Apple demonstrated such an exploitation. Final Cut Pro will offer a pixel-for-pixel rendering of a 1080p video in a portion of the full window. This is a quite brilliant and subtle use of those pixels.</p>

<p>You might do this yourself in your <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">favorite</a> text editor: with that extra resolution, knock a point size or two off your standard font. Legibility remains, but now you have room for more character columns.</p>

<p>Ditto for web pages. Let’s say you want to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/window-magnet/id441258766?mt=12">pin</a> a browser window to take up exactly the right-hand half of the screen. It’s effectively a 720px viewport (which “consumes” 1440 pixels). However, if you set the browser zoom to 90%, those 1440 pixels represent 800px of viewport. Zoom further to get more.</p>

<p>I dunno if I am gonna drop the coin for the pretty machine, but if did, the above is how I might justify it in productivity terms.</p>
