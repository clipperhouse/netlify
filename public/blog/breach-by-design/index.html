  <p>It appears that the hack against Google was perpetrated via their <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2010/01/13/surveillance-secruity-and-the-google-breach/">law enforcement compliance system</a>.
As <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;q=cache:0u0SxTUD7IoJ:www.crypto.com/papers/paa-ieee.pdf+risking+communications+security+potential+hazards&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;pid=bl&amp;amp;srcid=ADGEEShFTrobyhLOP-hEAmKJEvhM-IJRBufMLH-4ZcFgf7mJH2Hq6599v2XIjMkQSCcM6oHHA0eFwA07eUwv-mtFeMYaPieMPwMpHD4X42T0rKLWDdr40VlwhrN2O11qfRZKrkbLGrry&amp;amp;sig=AHIEtbSqRRaxuRhsezijUkpBdLFBC8etog">an eminent group of security experts argued in 2008</a>, the trend toward building surveillance capability into telecommunications architecture amounts to a breach-by-design, and a serious security risk. As the volume of requests from law enforcement at all levels grows, the compliance burdens on telcoms grow also — making it increasingly tempting to create automated portals to permit access to user information with minimal human intervention.</p>

<p>In other words, Google (and other comms companies) are required to build systems for providing wiretaps to government authorities.</p>

<p>That’s like catnip to hacker. If you want to reveal secrets in a system, target the area that’s designed for revealing secrets. Brilliant.</p>
