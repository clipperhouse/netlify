<p>A product process is typically something like Strategy → Discovery → Specification → Build → Delivery.</p>

<p>We on product teams understand most of these, but many companies struggle with “strategy”. It’s often mocked, and often with reason.</p>

<p>What is it <em>for</em>? What makes a good one?</p>

<h3 id="actionable">Actionable</h3>

<p>A PM, a developer, or a designer reading a strategy should think “Yes! I know <strong>what to do next</strong>.” Product should fall out of a strategy naturally and quickly.</p>

<p>A key component of “actionable” is <strong>persuasive</strong>. Our colleagues are the first market test of a strategy; if they are not won over, we have work to do.</p>

<p>Where projects don’t support a strategy, we drop those projects. If this never happens, the strategy is underdefined.</p>

<h3 id="accountable">Accountable</h3>

<p>A strategy <strong>characterizes the bet</strong> we wish to make. Is it a $10,000 bet, a $100,000 bet or a $1,000,000 bet? One month, three months or six months? What are the opportunity costs?</p>

<p>The strategy offers a clear picture of success, and a <strong>time frame</strong> by which it will be visible.</p>

<p>A good strategy is a <strong>hypothesis</strong>. Another word for “accountable” is <strong>testable</strong>.</p>

<p>We lose some bets; this is normal and good. We make decide to double down or to cut losses, and we do so crisply.</p>

<h3 id="researched">Researched</h3>

<p>A strategy is expected to do its homework. We <strong>talk to users</strong> and their proxies.</p>

<p>We engage with data scientists — not for the numbers, but for epistemology. The data scientists I know are great at turning <strong>philosophies into hypotheses</strong>. They describe what is knowable, and what is not, and why that’s OK.</p>

<p>We characterize <strong>uncertainty</strong>. When we make assumptions, we label them as such, and we don’t mistake them for facts. We <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">understand Bayes</a>.</p>
