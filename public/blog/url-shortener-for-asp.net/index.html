  <title>URL shortener for ASP.net - clipperhouse</title>
  <meta name="description" content="If you use Twitter, you are familiar with URL shortening services like bit.ly and tinyurl.com. They are useful for saving characters in the space-limited messages that Twitter allows.
However, in using them you lose control of your URL. End users don’t know what site they are going to before they click on it. Plus, your domain name is part of your brand — you want people to see it.

<div class="post-content"><p>If you use Twitter, you are familiar with URL shortening services like bit.ly and tinyurl.com. They are useful for saving characters in the space-limited messages that Twitter allows.</p>

<p>However, in using them you lose control of your URL. End users don’t know what site they are going to before they click on it. Plus, your domain name is part of your brand — you want people to see it.</p>

<p>To remedy this, I’ve created a URL shortener for ASP.net web sites. The shortened URL retains your domain, while trimming it down as much as possible.</p>

<p>I am just testing it out on my site right now — you’ll see it in the upper right. Give it a try for me.</p>

<p>Once I’m assured it’s running reasonably well, I’ll share it!</p>
