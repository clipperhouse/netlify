  <p>There’s been healthy talk about progress indicators in the age of ajax. In our will-to-design I think some things are being missed.</p>

<p>First, your browser’s UI already includes a progress indicator, and perhaps more than one:</p>

<p><img src="http://clipperhouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/progress-chrome2.png" alt="progress-chrome" /></p>

<p><img src="http://clipperhouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/status-chrome1.png" alt="status-chrome" /></p>

<p><img src="http://clipperhouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/progress-ff.png" alt="progress-ff" /></p>

<p>Your user is accustomed to these things, not unlike the back button. Why would we introduce a novel UI element, adding to the user’s cognitive load, when we already have them?</p>

<p>The shortcoming here is that, perhaps, the browser doesn’t offer obvious programmatic access to the above, or that it doesn’t occur to us to use it.</p>

<p>So I published <a href="https://gist.github.com/clipperhouse/6600675">this hack</a> to put the browser in a loading state programmatically. I am sure it can be improved upon, let me know your thoughts.</p>
