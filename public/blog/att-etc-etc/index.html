<h3 id="at-amp-t-etc-etc">AT&amp;T etc etc</h3>

<p>According to Gizmodo, AT&amp;T <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5428343/our-2009-12+city-3g-data-mega-test-att-won">comes out #1</a> for data performance. My interest is two-fold. First, I get a geek thrill is watching networks getting built. Second, I have a pet peeve about the whole AT&amp;T-hating thing lately.</p>

<p>I really don’t care about loving or hating any particular company, and I find it <a href="/blog/post/The-Man-sticks-it-to-The-Man-or-the-Country-club-Revolt-or-Whiteys-Revenge.aspx">so strange</a> that others do. I think the ratio of people who are complaining about AT&amp;T, versus those that are having measurable issues, is about 100:1.</p>

<p>I say this, subjectively, as a person who’s been on AT&amp;T with an iPhone for a couple of years now, in both SF and NYC. If the problem were that prevalent, certainly I would have experienced it. I don’t think I am especially lucky.</p>

<p>So what we are dealing with here is a monkey-see-monkey-do thing. You hate AT&amp;T? You want me too as well? Then, yes, I will!</p>

<p>There are first-hand opinions, and then there are blogger headlines, and it’s amazing how many people will substitute the latter for the former.</p>
