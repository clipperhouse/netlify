<div class="post-content"><p>I like the concept of e-books, if not their current state-of-the-art. The Kindle device sounds very impressive, I’ve only played with them a bit, and I know they have a lot of devoted fans.</p>

<p>One thing that gets underplayed is that “Kindle” is not simply a device, it’s Amazon’s e-book platform. So instead of spending $300 on the device, I am using the free <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=kcp_pc_mkt_lnd?docId=1000426311">Kindle for PC</a> application. (There is also an iPhone version but jeez, that’s pushing it in terms of readability.)</p>

<p>Amazon has decided it’s not going to restrict its e-book effort to a particular piece of hardware — instead, it’s a “Kindle everywhere” strategy. I wonder — will Apple do the same?</p>

<p>In other words, when (if) Apple introduces their <a href="/blog/post/Questions-about-the-Apple-tablet-that-no-one-is-answering-yet.aspx">publishing-oriented</a> tablet, will they simultaneously announce that you can get the e-reader software on your PC? There is a precedent — it’s called iTunes.</p>

<p>I suspect that this publication platform will use iTunes as its hub, and treat publications just like the media it already handles — books and magazines alongside songs, movies and podcasts. You can play those media on your PC just as easily as you can on the iPod. (And if they <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/19/apples-secret-cloud-strategy-and-why-lala-is-critical/">put it in the cloud</a>, all the better.)</p>

<p>If this comes to pass, you’ll be able to take advantage of the tablet’s e-reader functionality, without buying an expensive, first-generation device. Win.</p>
