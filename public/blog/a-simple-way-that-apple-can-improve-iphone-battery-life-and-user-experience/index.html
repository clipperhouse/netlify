<p>On the Blackberry, there is an external light that flashes a different color based on new messages. Then, when you log in to the BB home screen, the Messages icon has a little badge indicating new messages, also by color. So either one or zero interactions is enough.</p>

<p>On the iPhone, you get neither of these things. You have to log in at a minimum. Then, the mail icon will tell you the number of <em>unread</em> messages, but gives no indication of whether they are new since you last checked.</p>

<p>So you then need to go into the Mail app, then into your Inbox, to see what’s new.</p>

<p>Not only is this relatively time-consuming (when repeated throughout the day), but that much interaction is work for the battery.</p>

<p>Battery life on mobile devices is all about <strong>micromanagement</strong>. Software developers look at every operation and ask, “can we <em>not</em> do this right now?”. It’s always looking for ways <em>not</em> to refresh the screen, to minimize use of radios (like WiFi or GPS), to avoid calculations that don’t benefit the end user right now. It adds up!</p>

<p>So if the iPhone would just <strong>give some indication of new messages without logging in</strong> (as it does with SMS, for example), this would save both end-user time and several dozen battery-draining operations a day. I bet this would save several minutes of battery life (and brain time) for an email junkie like me.</p>
