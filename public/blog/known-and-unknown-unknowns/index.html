<p>Software is unique in that solved problems are easy to build on. Once a problem is considered “solved”, the solution can be exploited with little or no cost. (When’s the last time you worried about the TCP/IP stack when building a web app?)</p>

<p>Therefore, if a software developer is asked to create something new, she is in all likelihood <strong>solving a problem that has not been solved before</strong>. After all, if there’s already a solution, why write new code?</p>

<p>Because it’s a new problem, we don’t have much real certainty about the difficulty of the problem, and any predictions we make are speculative. Jeff says:
[…] control is ultimately illusory on software development projects. If you want to move your project forward, the only reliable way to do that is to cultivate a deep sense of software craftsmanship and professionalism around it.</p>

<p>This is an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PDZFCK?tag=clipperhouse-20&amp;amp;camp=0&amp;amp;creative=0&amp;amp;linkCode=as1&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000PDZFCK&amp;amp;adid=0GX7JTS6A8176WV9VTZ4&amp;amp;">empirical and experimental view</a>, and it is the right one, IMHO. Predictions about where a software project will go, and how long it will take, are educated guesses. <strong>Sometimes we recognize what we don’t know; usually, we don’t.</strong></p>

<p>This needn’t be a showstopper; in fact, it’s the thing that thrills me about software. The danger is in placing too much weight on your predictions.</p>

<p>I’ve found this very hard to communicate to clients. They want two contradictory things: on the one hand, they want their feedback to be respected and built into the project. On the other hand, they want certainty about schedules and costs.</p>

<p>Both are perfectly reasonable desires. But they are at cross-purposes — each piece of feedback generates a new feedback cycle. The list of to-do’s grows exponentially with time.</p>

<p>I think continuous feedback is a great way to make really robust, personable, <em>organic</em> software. It gives businesses real proprietary advantages: the software reflects the uniqueness of the organization.</p>

<p>But it comes at the expense of certainty. Recognizing that we don’t know what we don’t know — and that that’s OK — is a leap that’s hard for many to take.</p>
