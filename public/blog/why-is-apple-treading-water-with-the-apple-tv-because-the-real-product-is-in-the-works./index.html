It still doesn’t do what we expect of a “set-top box” or “media center”: things like recording live TV.</p>

<p>The Apple TV is proving that it does not belong in those categories of hardware above. <strong>It’s more correct to think of it as an iTunes extender</strong> — an elegant way to get your movies and music onto the TV, assuming that iTunes is your starting point.</p>

<p>Jason Snell <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/143580/2009/10/appletv_3_first_look.html">wonders</a> what I wonder: where are we going with this? Apple is certainly capable of making a Tivo-killer. Why haven’t they?</p>

<p>I see internal politics at Apple, but perhaps not for the worse. The Apple TV is being held back in terms of features because its big brother — Apple’s real TV play — will be released sometime in the future.</p>

<p>The real play? <strong>A set-top box in partnership with one of the major cable companies.</strong> I admit, I am rehashing my <a href="/blog/post/When-Apple-aligns-with-a-carrier-act-II.aspx">previous speculation</a>.</p>

<p>But the precedent is there: Apple partnered with a major carrier (AT&amp;T) bring out the iPhone. They’ll do it again, this time by fixing the often appalling (Tivo excepted) DVR experience.</p>

<p>Who will the carrier be? I have no idea — but AT&amp;T U-verse service runs on Microsoft IPTV software, so short of a coup we’d have to rule them out. Verizon is a possibility — its FIOS set-top box is functional but not great. Ditto Comcast.</p>

<p>Or perhaps Apple will start with a smaller regional carrier like Cox or Cablevision. Let’s see.</p>
