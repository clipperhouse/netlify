<p>I’ve generally believed they must be doing the latter. These days, a lot of a page’s content may be generated by Javascript and therefore would not appear in the raw HTML as served by the web server. A lot of relevant content would be missed by the simpler method.</p>

<p>More broadly, the users’ concept of a page is “the stuff I see in the browser”. The customer expectation is that Google “sees” what they see. Running Javascript would be necessary to achieve this.</p>

<p>Today I got a bit of confirmation from my SiteMeter stats:</p>

<p>SiteMeter runs a client-side Javascript in the footer of my page, which communicates the traffic data back to their servers and also displays a little image. Unlike server-side logs, <strong>the page has to be rendered for SiteMeter to count the visit.</strong></p>

<p>The fact that the above visit from the Googlebot was counted at all is a good hint that they rendered my page to index it. Further, you’ll note that SiteMeter thinks the “browser” has Javascript enabled.</p>

<p>So I imagine that the big indexing farm at Google actually uses Chrome, which downloads the page, renders it, and then saves the fully-realized DOM results. It’s like a thousand automated users.</p>
