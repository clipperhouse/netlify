<p>I recently put a new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IJA1EG?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=clipperhouse-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002IJA1EG">SSD</a> in my system (yay!) and did a clean install of Windows 7, Visual Studio, etc. I found that when viewing my web app on localhost (using the Cassini web server built into VS), it was very slow. This was true across browsers.</p>

<p>Turns out it’s a DNS thing — the lookup for “localhost” was apparently going out to the DNS server, a waste. You can easily “short-circuit” this by modifying your hosts file. It’s in the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc folder.</p>

<p>Simply un-comment the localhost entry at the bottom of that file, like so:
`# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.<br />
 <strong>127.0.0.1       localhost</strong></p>

<h1 id="1-localhost">::1             localhost`</h1>

<p>It made things lickety-split for me.</p>

<p><em>Tip: you’ll need to run Notepad as an administrator to modify the file.</em></p>
