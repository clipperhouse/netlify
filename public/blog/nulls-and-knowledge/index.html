<div class="post-content"><p>Eric Lippert has a worthwhile post about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2009/05/14/null-is-not-empty.aspx">what nulls are and why we use them</a>. I like reading Eric because I think we think alike — computer languages are languages, with grammar and semantics.</p>

<p>Thinking this way allows one to design architectures that are intuitive. After all, when you create an object model, you are effectively creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_programming_language">domain-specific language</a>. Even it it’s written in C#, GetWidgets() is only meaningful within your business. You are creating vocabulary (if not grammar, necessarily).</p>

<p>Thus, your code should be as readable, semantic and unambiguous as any prose that you write.</p>

<p>But back to the null thing — I find them incredibly convenient but I don’t see them discussed in simple terms often enough.</p>

<p>A null is a very valuable piece of metadata. It means “I don’t know”. I find them especially useful with booleans. Sometimes true and false aren’t enough.</p>

<p>For example, I often create structs which carry a bunch of search parameters, which later get translated into a database query. Let’s say I have a table of Person, with a bit field that indicates IsManager.</p>

<p>When doing adhoc queries, there are three possibilities that I care about: give me managers (IsManager=true), give me non-managers (IsManager=false), or I don’t care if they are a manager or not (IsManager=null). This third possibility allows me to remove that parameter from the query entirely. A nullable bool is the solution.</p>

<p>I have a bit of (amateur) background in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">epistemology</a>, so perhaps that’s why this sort of thing lights up my brain. One of the great scourges of science (including social sciences) is the belief that someone knows something.</p>

<p>You might have a very good idea of something. You might have incomplete information, but lack the luxury of indecision. These are the elements of daily life — but they are not the same as knowing.</p>

<p>The danger is in the fallacy of the sure bet, or “what could <a href="http://beta.sling.com/video/show/31898/92/Arriving-At-Itchy-And-Scratchy-Land">possibly</a> go wrong”? A sense of what might go wrong requires both great discipline and great creativity — and is fundamental to any sort of scientific endeavor, like, say, software.</p>

<p>Great engineers treat ignorance an important piece of data; mediocre engineers see certainty where it doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>PS: If this sort of thing lights up your brain too, I can’t recommend enough Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s two books, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812975219?tag=clipperhouse-20&amp;amp;camp=0&amp;amp;creative=0&amp;amp;linkCode=as1&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0812975219&amp;amp;adid=0EAHD85E2DJ83HX26JXJ&amp;amp;">Fooled by Randomness</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400063515?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=clipperhouse-20&amp;amp;link_code=as3&amp;amp;camp=211189&amp;amp;creative=373489&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1400063515">The Black Swan</a>.</p>
