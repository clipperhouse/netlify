<div class="post-content"><p>I don’t underestimate Apple’s ability to create unprecedented stuff, and to make it much better than anyone imagined. Yet for all the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2009/tc20091229_795528.htm">breathlessness</a> about the supposed Apple tablet, no one seems to be asking the right questions.</p>

<p>First, <strong>what problem is it trying to solve?</strong> We know what problems laptops and smartphones solve. What’s the tablet solving?</p>

<p><strong>Is it a “third” device?</strong> The first device that you are willing to carry is your mobile phone; the second is your laptop. If the tablet replaces neither of these things, will you carry around a third device?</p>

<p><strong>Will it leave the house?</strong> Are you going to walk around the mall with this thing?</p>

<p>Given these questions…</p>

<p>We can assume that its main purpose is not as a communication device. Video conferencing and Facebook are not why you buy it. (At home, your computer does a better job. Outside, your iPhone is more handy.)</p>

<p>It will also not be a laptop replacement. You won’t do spreadsheets or compose presentations on it. (It will do those things, you wouldn’t buy it for that reason. Your laptop does a better job.)</p>

<p>You won’t kick back and watch a movie on this thing. (Again, you <em>could</em>, but your TV does a better job of it.)</p>

<p>That leaves us with one killer app: <strong>publications</strong>.</p>

<p>You are already carrying one or more of those (book, magazine, newspaper), so this obviates the third-device problem. It might leave the house, but not all the time. And the problem it’s trying to solve is that <strong>paper sucks</strong>.</p>

<p>Paper is not searchable or updatable and does not integrate with other media. And it takes up space. Paper is, however, very readable, portable and user-friendly, and for those reasons, it is still a mainstream medium.</p>

<p>This implies, then, that the tablet must be a Kindle on steroids: publications, yes, but with interactivity and apps that enhance the reading experience enough that people will give up paper. Which brings us to…</p>

<p><strong>Will the tablet have e-reader software on it?</strong> It seems, given the above, that it obviously must. But it can’t be one-size-fits-all, since publications will want to differentiate — if they are to survive, the medium itself must evolve. Fitting into a generic template won’t do.</p>

<p>So the e-reader software will be <strong>more of a platform than an app</strong>, not unlike a highly purpose-built web browser.</p>

<p>Publications will be responsible for authoring their “tablet editions” in the same way that they have to author their web sites. The platform will offer rich fundamentals (typography, images, audio &amp; video, navigation, subscriptions, DRM) but the content providers will develop the user experience. <strong>Publications will compete on both functionality <em>and</em> content.</strong></p>

<p>So the sales pitch in January will be: it’s not just a device, it’s the new publisher’s platform.</p>
