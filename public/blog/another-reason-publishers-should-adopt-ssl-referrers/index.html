Here’s a more self-interested take.</p>

<p>When a user clicks is on a HTTPS site (such as Google, Hacker News, Twitter*…) and the link to which they navigate is plain HTTP, the referrer header <strong>will not be included</strong> with the request. So a publisher that receives incoming traffic from such a site will be blind in terms or referrers.</p>

<p>If the publisher does run HTTPS, they will receive the referrer.</p>

<p>The publisher might or might not care about this piece of data, but this undermines their ability to know their best traffic sources or aggregate reporting. I can’t imagine a publisher letting it go so easily. So SSL-up, already.</p>
