<p>There is a setting in Google Calendar for time zone. Changed that. No joy.</p>

<p>Finally, I looked deep into the iPhone’s Mail, Contacts and Calendar settings — and way at the bottom of that screen, you set the time zone for the <em>calendar</em>. And it wasn’t the same as the phone’s time zone. Sheesh. Now my calendars are synced up.</p>
