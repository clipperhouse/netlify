<p>I got <a href="https://twitter.com/clipperhouse/status/583393327757860864">trolled</a> by a facetious article on Go on April 1. But it did trigger a conversation about why Go doesn’t do certain things other languages do.</p>

<p>The answer, in several cases, is that Go chooses to make a clear distinction between expressions and statements. It chooses not to conflate them.</p>

<p>By way of definition, an expression is a thing that has (returns) a value. A statement is an imperative command to <em>do something</em>, but itself does not have a value.</p>

<p>I’ll use C# by way of comparison.</p>

<h4 id="increment-operators">Increment operators</h4>

<p>Most C-family languages have an operator like a++, which says “increment the value of a value by 1”.</p>

<p>In most languages, this expression has a return value. In Go, it does not.</p>

<p><strong>C#</strong></p>

<p>var a = 5;<br />
Console.WriteLine(a++);<br />
// prints 5 (though a is now valued at 6)</p>

<p><strong>Go</strong></p>

<p>a := 5<br />
fmt.Println(a++)<br />
// syntax error: unexpected ++</p>

<p>To be clear, a++ is a valid statement in Go; it increments by 1. It does not, however, return a value, avoiding error-prone patterns like if (a++ == 6) { …</p>

<h4 id="assignment">Assignment</h4>

<p>In C#, assignments have return values.</p>

<p><strong>C#</strong></p>

<p>int a;<br />
Console.WriteLine(a = 5);<br />
// prints 5</p>

<p>The expression a = 5 has a return value of 5. Further shenanigans:</p>

<p>int a;<br />
Console.WriteLine((a = 5) == 5);<br />
// prints True</p>

<p>The expression (a = 5) returns a value of 5, which is then compared to 5.</p>

<p><strong>Go</strong></p>

<p>In Go, assignments are statements.</p>

<p>a := 5<br />
fmt.Println(a = 6)<br />
// syntax error: unexpected =</p>

<p>a = 6 is a valid statement. It is not, however, an expression (and thus can’t be evaluated and printed).</p>

<h4 id="ternaries">Ternaries</h4>

<p>You are probably familiar with an expression like condition ? value : other. It’s generally understood as syntactic sugar for an if-else statement, with a return value.</p>

<p><strong>C#</strong></p>

<p>var temp = 50;<br />
Console.WriteLine(temp &gt; 30 ? “warm” : “cold”);<br />
// prints warm</p>

<p><strong>Go</strong></p>

<p>Go doesn’t have ternaries! Reason being, it’s sugar for an if-else, and if-else’s are statements, not expressions.</p>

<p>You may be detecting a pattern here: Go prefers orthogonality over sugar. There are classes of (human) error that result from a statement also being an expression, and Go chooses to make that class of error less likely.</p>
