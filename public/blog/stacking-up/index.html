<p>I’ve been a reader and admirer of <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com">Joel</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000679.html">Jeff</a> for some years now, so I am thrilled to be working alongside them. (Hopefully they won’t catch on to the fact that I don’t write code, I merely copy-and-paste from Stack Overflow.)</p>

<p>In fact, I wasn’t really looking for a job, what with Alikewise and some freelance <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/seeminglee/4648809754/">gigs</a> I’ve been doing. But upon hearing that they were <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/about/hiring">hiring</a>, I had to <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">put in a CV</a> to see what would happen.</p>

<p>I am flattered by their interest, and hope to assist in their <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/37328/my-godits-full-of-unicorns">goals</a> of world domination do some great stuff.</p>

<p>I’ll reveal an unflattering truth: I kinda like thinking I am the smartest guy in the room. The time I’ve spent at S.O. so far has cured me of that fantasy. Wish me luck.</p>
