  <p>There have been some interesting posts lately <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/12/what-does-programmer-productivity-look-like.html">asking</a> the question, “if some programmers are 10 times as productive as others, why aren’t they paid 10 times as much?”. It’s a good question, though I don’t think the recent posts quite get to the heart of it.</p>

<p>Some have said that it’s a sociological thing — that we, as a culture, generally don’t accept great disparities in pay. Within a mediocre organization, that might be true. (James Kwak <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2009/12/24/salespeople-and-programmers/">hypothesizes</a> that the market price is set by these mediocre organizations.)</p>

<p>But <strong>markets tend to clear</strong>, which means that over time the value should accrue to the better performer. The 10x programmer at the mediocre company will have a great incentive to go out on her own; if her productivity allows her to take on 10 times as many clients, she will net 10x the pay.</p>

<p>The problem is that the original question is a fallacy. <strong>We don’t know, <em>a priori</em>, who these 10x programmers are.</strong> Simply asserting their existence, and then musing about their pay, puts the cart before the horse.</p>

<p>The 10x programmer doesn’t exist until they do. I agree with John Cook that <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/12/23/why-programmers-are-not-paid-in-proportion-to-their-productivity/">measuring productivity is hard</a>, but we do have a way. Call it Sherman’s Fairly Obvious Productivity Test:
<strong>If our newly-independent programmer does not make 10x the money, we must admit that she is not the 10x programmer we thought she was.</strong></p>

<p>The essence of my argument is this: “productivity” is a metric in a vacuum. It’s incomplete and unempirical. The definition of productivity must have a <strong>relationship to the value of what is being produced</strong>. And the only way to measure the value is market response.</p>

<p>This market response might be measured in money that accrues to the programmer; in the case of open source, it might be measured in the hard value derived by users of the software (e.g., the ROI of a company adopting Linux).</p>

<p>An expertly-prepared steak, served to a vegetarian, does not make one a great cook. Driving a Prius in the wrong direction is not fuel-efficient.</p>

<p>And so the ability to solve technical problems, with great wisdom and elegance, does not a “productive” programmer make. <strong>The productive programmer must prove the ability to deliver things <em>of value to their customer</em></strong>, broadly defined. Anything short of this test is academic.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p><em>PS. In fact, I do think these 10x programmers exist: they create startups with the windfalls that you hear about. They go by the names of Bill Gates, Linus Torvalds, Paul Graham, etc.</em></p>
