<div class="post-content"><p>John Maeda of RISD has a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20131025193453-34374336-disrupting-the-diploma-a-college-president-s-view-of-the-future?trk=mp-author-card&amp;amp;_mSplash=1">riff</a> about the future of college credentials, including the notion of an automated ‘degree’, which is generated by a machine based on the sum your achievements. He makes an analogy to Coinstar: pour in a bunch of individually valuable stuff, get out some paper which aggregates its value.</p>

<p>It’s not that crazy of an idea; it only sounds crazy because we are using our current terminology of credentials as a certificate of education.</p>

<p>A degree from Stanford has value because it is considered a predictor of ability. But it’s only that: a predictor, whose accuracy one takes on faith. I recall seeing studies indicating that one’s school is only a predictor of success early in one’s career; that in less than ten years, one’s alma mater is no longer detectable as a signal. [cite?]</p>

<p>So in that case, the diploma is a relatively weak predictor. In blunt terms, sure, 90% of the population could not get a Stanford BA. But those that do, might or might accomplish what one expects.</p>

<p>What if institutional credentials were empirical? Stanford and MIT could offer such credentials, based on their own emphases and models. A person could then have several ‘degrees’ from Harvard, Princeton and Caltech, as one’s accomplishment is used as an input into their respective models.</p>

<p>Which of course leads one to ask what a ‘degree’ is? As it stands now, it’s a _cred_ential, in that it communicates that one can _cred_ibly hope that your fresh new hire will do good work. But it is only weakly empirical. ‘Credibility’ is a loose idea that one falls back on in the absence of predictive data.</p>

<p>Imagine a better system, where Stanford, MIT and Carnegie-Mellon compete for predictive strength of their credentialing models. Where they forecast your success at age 20, revisit it when you turn 30, and open source the results.</p>

<p>Our current higher-educational institutions might serve that role, but it’s not what they do right now. If they’re smart, they’ll consider moving in that direction, or see themselves disrupted by nimbler, more-empirical, more-<em>credible</em> rivals.</p>
