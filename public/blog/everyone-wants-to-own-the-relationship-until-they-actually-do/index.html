Google is selling the phone directly to end-users. That means many users are turning to it first, and the search giant doesn’t have the kind of customer support that mobile-phone users are accustomed to.[…] Another [customer] using the name SouthFlGuy was also sent back and forth between HTC and T-Mobile after finding no help from Google. “I guess I was under the wrong impression but I thought Google would handle the service on the phone,” he wrote.</p>

<p>This goes to the “dumb pipes” argument we often hear: that our dinosaur-like carriers (AT&amp;T et al) need to stop trying to be clever and just offer raw bandwidth. No software, no upsells, just give us a pipe.</p>

<p>The carriers, not surprisingly, want to control the customer relationship, and so do what they can to “value-add”. This might take the form of their own app stores or media subscriptions. Being a commodity bandwidth provider is a low-margin, undifferentiated business.</p>

<p>When you are dealing with a mass customer base — this might be consumers or it might be large enterprises — <strong>support is the unsexy thing that no one wants to talk about</strong>. Answering the phone for millions of customers is no small task, and it’s not something that you can do well at the flick of a switch.</p>

<p>And so Google is discovering what Microsoft and AT&amp;T have known for a long time: support is a whole business unto itself. <strong>“Owning the relationship” means “answering the phone”</strong> — these things are synonymous. Anybody can write decent code or put up cell towers — but really handling customers requires a more mature company.</p>

<p>Google is taking a page from Apple’s iPhone playbook: take back the customer relationship. It can be great for consumers and for the companies that succeed in doing it. Just be careful what you wish for.</p>
