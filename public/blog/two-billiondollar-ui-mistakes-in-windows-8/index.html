  <p>I am very interested in Windows 8 both as a user and as a tech industry watcher. Big bet, big changes.</p>

<p>Given the size of the bet, I believe Microsoft is making two UI mistakes that will cost them billions if they are released.</p>

<p>It took me, a developer and lifelong Windows user, quite a while to figure out how to search from the start screen. There is no search box. What would you do, given the above?</p>

<p>The answer is, just start typing, and those keystrokes will be interpreted as a search term.</p>

<p>Note that there is nothing to type <em>into</em>. My parents, and most computer users, don’t type <em>at</em> interfaces. They type into boxes with a little flashing line.</p>

<p>The problem with bad UI is not simply productivity. It’s that people, when they can’t figure out a machine, <strong>feel stupid</strong>. It’s not rational, but it is an emotional truth. Bad UI makes people feel bad about themselves.</p>

<p>Second issue: the “desktop”. It’s not the worst thing in the world, given that Windows has 20 years of legacy apps to support. But here’s the problem:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4boTbv9_nU]">youtube [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4boTbv9_nU]</a></p>

<p>How to get out of that desktop and back to where one started? I know the answer, but only after I stumbled upon it after several minutes. And I still don’t know how to do it with a mouse.</p>

<p>This user, a presumably smart and well-meaning guy, is made to feel stupid. (Be sure to watch til the end for the punchline.)</p>

<p>As Kathy Sierra says, we don’t buy products because we feel good about the product. We buy products that make us feel better about ourselves — looking better, feeling smarter, more able to communicate and create.</p>

<p>A poor UI is an attack on self-esteem. Humans, not consciously by the way, shy away from such things. This might cost Microsoft dearly.</p>
