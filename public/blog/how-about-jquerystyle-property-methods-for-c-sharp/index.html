  <title>How about jQuery-style “property methods” for C#? - clipperhouse</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Here’s an idiom that I think would be useful in C#: “property methods” in the style of jQuery.
There are many methods in jQ — html(), val(), width() — that are getters when they are called without an argument, and setters when they are. This makes for some very nice fluent code: $(“#someElement”).width(“100px”).html(“hello there”);
window.alert(“The width of #someElement is ” &#43; $(“#someElement”).width());
I’d love to be able to do this in C#, to bring in some of that fluency and terseness.">

<div class="post-content"><p>Here’s an idiom that I think would be useful in C#: “property methods” in the style of jQuery.</p>

<p>There are many methods in jQ — html(), val(), width() — that are getters when they are called without an argument, and setters when they are. This makes for some very nice fluent code:
$(“#someElement”).width(“100px”).html(“hello there”);<br />
window.alert(“The width of #someElement is ” + $(“#someElement”).width());</p>

<p>I’d love to be able to do this in C#, to bring in some of that fluency and terseness. For example, I currently have to write:
myPerson.FirstName = “Joe”;<br />
myPerson.LastName = “Smith”;<br />
myPerson.ZipCode = “12345”;</p>

<p>The code smell here is that I refer to myPerson 3 times. Don’t you just wanna say “Yeah, I get it, myPerson, sheesh.” Wouldn’t it be better to write:
myPerson.FirstName(“Joe”).LastName(“Smith”).ZipCode(“12345”);</p>

<p>Of course I could implement the above with overloads and private fields. But I shouldn’t need to do that much notation.</p>

<p>I think it can be done in C# without new keywords. Simply allow methods to have get and set bodies:
public class Person<br />
{<br />
public string FirstName() { get; set ; }<br />
public string LastName () { get; set ; }<br />
public string ZipCode () { get; set ; }<br />
}</p>

<p>The compiler would interpret these much like regular properties, backed by (automagical) private fields, with the caveat that a passed value invokes <em>set</em>. <strong>The setter returns the parent object</strong>, giving us the fluency.</p>

<p>And as with properties, you could add bodies to get and set as you desire, where the <em>value</em> argument is implied for <em>set</em>.</p>

<p>Overall, this is the equivalent of:
public class Person<br />
{<br />
public string FirstName() // getter<br />
{<br />
 return _FirstName;<br />
}public Person FirstName(string value) // setter<br />
{<br />
 _FirstName = value;<br />
 return this; // the fluent bit<br />
}private string _FirstName; // backing store</p>

<p>//…and repeat for each property<br />
}</p>

<p>Again, I <em>could</em> write my classes this way. But that would be so much boilerplate, uninformative code. Please compiler, do it for me.</p>
