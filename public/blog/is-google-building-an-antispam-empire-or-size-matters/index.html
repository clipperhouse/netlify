<div class="post-content"><p>Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/teaching-computers-to-read-google.html">acquired</a> reCAPTCHA today, a company that provides a simple means of adding a spam-limiting mechanism to your site. (I’ve implemented it several times and I recommend it to clients.)</p>

<p>There are technologies where size matters more than others. One of them is spam-fighting.</p>

<p>Spam, whether in email or in the comments of a blog, is fought with data. It is a statistical game — lots of very fast computers doing their best to ask, how much does this message resemble spam? Or did it more likely come from a human? Getting it wrong — being too tight or too loose — will piss off a lot of people.</p>

<p>Getting this right would be hard for a small company, even if they have great algorithms. Why? Because you need data: <a href="/blog/post/Ite28099s-the-data-not-the-algorithm.aspx">lots of new data</a>, all the time.</p>

<p>Spam is high-volume and constantly adapting. Tracking these adaptations, from which one can build a sample set and glean intelligence, requires a lot of input.</p>

<p>To get a lot of input, you need a lot of users, and reCAPTCHA did a great job of acquiring users. They get (presumably) millions of hits a day, and each of those hits is a test of “spamness”. This allows them to see a lot of trends.</p>

<p>And, they (presumably) can correlate IP addresses with each of those test results. So spam is not just what, but who.</p>

<p>Google has an obvious interest in fighting spam for Gmail. They’ve done a great job so far, in my experience. Combine that with reCAPTCHA and one sees Google building a serious anti-spam arsenal.</p>

<p>My prediction: Google’s next purchase in this space will be <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>.</p>
