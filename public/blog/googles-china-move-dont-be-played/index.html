  <p>Hat tip to Sarah Lacy <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/12/google%E2%80%99s-china-stance-more-about-business-than-thwarting-evil/">for laying it out</a> so well:
<strong>Google is ready to burn bridges.</strong> This is not how negotiations are done in China, and Google has done well enough there to know that. You don’t get results by pressuring the government in a public, English-language blog post. If Google were indeed still working with the government this letter would not have been posted because it has likely slammed every door shut […] This was a scorched earth move, aimed at buying Google some good will in the rest of the world; Chinese customers and staff were essentially just thrown under the bus.</p>

<p>Google is a self-interested company. Self-interested companies know that righteousness and bridge burning do not sustain successful businesses. Therefore, the company must have come to the conclusion that their business in China is not a successful one.</p>

<p>Google is <a href="http://brainstormtech.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2009/12/28/google-v-baidu-which-company-will-win-china/">hovering under 20%</a> in market share in China. They are losing to Baidu. Seems to me they’ve already made a business decision to back out, and are cynically using that fact to drum up some PR sympathy.</p>

<p>I have no complaints about embarrassing the Chinese government; <em>any</em> gov’t really. But Google’s been compromising with the Chinese authorities for a long time. Why are they so upset all of a sudden, now?</p>

<p>I am sure that someone is trying to hack their systems, as the company claims. But I bet that someone is trying to hack Google, all day, every day, in every country of the world. This time set them off? Please.</p>

<p>I happen to agree with Google’s initial decision to enter the Chinese market under less-than-ideal circumstances. For the Chinese people, some Google is better than no Google. It creates a foothold for future openness. It was bold — they could easily have not tried.</p>

<p>But the current situation is not a passionate reaction to an outrage, and there is no mention of what’s best for Google’s Chinese users or employees. This is making the best of a bad situation by scoring a few points with the digerati, of which you and I are a part.</p>

<p>Don’t be evil? Start with sincerity.</p>
