  <p>So, my previous bit on the attraction of <a href="/blog/post/URL-shortener-for-ASPnet.aspx">shortening one’s own URLs</a> seems to have some traction. Obviously it wasn’t original to me, but I see that sites like Ars Technica and Flickr have begun doing their own URL shortening. Check it out:</p>

<p><a href="http://arst.ch/4fj">http://arst.ch/4fj</a></p>

<p>I had a similar notion a few weeks ago. In addition to shortening one’s own URLs, one might even use a shorter domain name that evokes the full name. So I registered CLPRHO.US and clipperhou.se. Haven’t started using them yet — I was concerned that they may look spammy since they are unfamiliar. But then again, pretty much all the URL shorteners look spammy.</p>

<p>I also learned that <a href="http://laughingmeme.org/2009/04/03/url-shortening-hinting/">others are thinking about this</a>, using devices like rel=canonical to allow these things to be discovered by others.</p>
