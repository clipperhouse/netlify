<p>IE6’s trend of loss leveled off a little bit, to 0.92 percentage points, or 4% of its user base for the month. <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=7102&amp;amp;tag=nl.e539">Adrian Kingsley-Hughes</a> needs to educate himself as to <a href="http://blog.digg.com/?p=878">why people use old browsers</a>. “UPGRADE PEOPLE!!” is a swing and a miss.</p>
