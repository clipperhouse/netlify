Actually, they are, it’s just underexploited. For example, this little radio app allows me to deep-link specific radio stations as tiles on my (Win Phone 7) home screen.
Guess what? The tile has a URL, pointed to a specific place in the app. Now, I haven’t dug deeply enough to know about the security boundaries, but it seems to me it would be a small step to allow the app to register a namespace on the phone (app://appid) and expose endpoints to any other app." />

<p>Actually, they are, it’s just underexploited. For example, this <a href="http://tunein.com/mobile/windows/">little radio app</a> allows me to deep-link specific radio stations as tiles on my (Win Phone 7) home screen.</p>

<p>Guess what? The tile <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh202979%28v=VS.92%29.aspx">has a URL</a>, pointed to a specific place in the app. Now, I haven’t dug deeply enough to know about the security boundaries, but it seems to me it would be a small step to allow the app to register a namespace on the phone (app://appid) and expose endpoints to any other app.</p>

<p>This seems like a nice way to bridge the gap between the advantages of phone and web. iPhone allows <a href="http://mobileorchard.com/apple-approved-iphone-inter-process-communication/">protocol handlers</a> which are the same idea, putting the namespace at the front of the URL.</p>

<p>(Of course, URLs would need to be managed just like public, web URLs — you’d want them to be stable, and deliberate about what’s exposed.)</p>

<p>A future of on-device linking may be closer than we think.</p>
