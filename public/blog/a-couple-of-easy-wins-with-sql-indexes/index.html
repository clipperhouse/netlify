A couple of actionable takeaways that stuck with me are about creating and choosing indexes.</p>

<p>Indexes in SQL for me are kind of a black art. You look at Query Execution plans, try to intuit where the work is being done, and then make a guess as to what index might help. Then you see if things are “faster”. I never <em>really</em> know which ones are helping in an empirical way.</p>

<p>Turns out you can query SQL Server itself to find out. Check out this <a href="http://www.sqlserverpedia.com/wiki/Find_Missing_Indexes">Find Missing Indexes</a> query by Brent. And if you are wondering whether your existing indexes are doing any good, try this <a href="http://www.sqlserverpedia.com/wiki/Find_Indexes_Not_In_Use">Find Indexes Not In Use</a> query.</p>

<p>(As a practical matter, Brent recommends only changing a few indexes at a time. Keep the experiment controlled.)</p>

<p>These scripts look like great 80–20 solutions: a small amount of work to find the the most glaring issues. It’s the sort of thing a guru like Brent would charge big $$ for. ;)</p>
