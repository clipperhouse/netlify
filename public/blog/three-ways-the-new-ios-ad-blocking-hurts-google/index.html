<p>Apple’s ad blocking API is good for users and bad for Google, in 3 ways:</p>

<h4 id="1-blocking-ads-of-course">1: Blocking ads, of course</h4>

<p>This is the most direct way that Apple’s API is bad for Google: more mobile users can block ads, which are the basis of Google’s business.</p>

<p>(That said, the <a href="https://medium.com/@clipperhouse/three-outcomes-of-the-adpocalypse-7428b49c4c28#941f">economics</a> are such that it will not be a linear relationship between “ads blocked” and “$ lost”, due to the incredible wastefulness of the status quo.)</p>

<h4 id="2-ios-becomes-a-better-user-experience">2: iOS becomes a better user experience</h4>

<p>Because Android does not offer an ad blocking API, iOS gains a competitive advantage in user experience. Most users don’t deliberately choose a mobile OS, but if they become accustomed to a less noisy experience on iOS, their preference will only be strengthened.</p>

<h4 id="3-safari-becomes-a-better-user-experience">3: Safari becomes a better user experience</h4>

<p>I generally prefer Chrome on my iPad. But in the few days I’ve been on iOS9 (and having experimented with the Peace and Crystal ad blockers), I now find myself preferring Safari where I didn’t before.</p>

<p>Technical note: Chrome on iOS <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-and-safari-view-controller-the-future-of-web-views/">could adopt</a> Safari’s ad blockers, if it chooses, though I suspect it won’t.</p>

<h4 id="third-parties">Third parties?</h4>

<p>Apple offers the technical means for embedded browsers to adopt <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-and-safari-view-controller-the-future-of-web-views/">Safari’s functionality</a>. An example of “embedded” would be Twitter for iOS, which brings up a browser in-app when you click a link. I haven’t worked out whether it’s in Twitter’s interest to do this.</p>
