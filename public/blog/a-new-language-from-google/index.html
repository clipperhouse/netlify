  <p>Neat, Google has a <a href="http://golang.org/doc/go_tutorial.html">new language called Go</a>. Clever branding, that.</p>

<p>It seems to be Google’s attempt to step into the Java/C# space. Perhaps I don’t know enough about languages to make such an assertion, but the thing that clued me in was its <strong>type safety</strong>. That seems decidedly <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">untrendy</a>.</p>

<p>Google seems to have <a href="http://golang.org/doc/go_lang_faq.html#inheritance">stepped over</a> a basic OO concept: inheritance. Smart C# programmers know to use interfaces instead of inheritance, where possible. It’s an important way to keep coupling as loose as possible. (I am an intermediate C# guy, so that means I do it often but not often enough.)</p>

<p>Go only uses interfaces — no inheritance — and it does this <a href="http://golang.org/doc/go_faq.html#Is_Go_an_object-oriented_language">by design</a>.</p>
