<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/stephen-anderson/2012-september-7/">This article</a> offers a lot of sound advice on hiring a designer. As techies, we’re often out of our depth in knowing what a good designer is — often, we hire a decorator instead (or as the article calls it, a stylist).</p>

<p>Style is important, but it’s not the main goal of design. Design encompasses the user’s whole experience. Design is the product.</p>

<p>The designer is the user’s advocate. I mean that in the full political sense: they are a public defender making the case for a client.</p>

<p>It’s a political hire, because the interest of many employees is not aligned with the user — more so in a larger company.</p>

<p>Techies, for example, often want to build what’s most technically interesting. Or, we want the design to be <em>decided</em>, so we can implement, which we’re good at. These aren’t bad things! But they are orthogonal to the user’s needs, or worse.</p>

<p>We’re unlikely to question the utility of a screen, or a button, or a set of fields. We’re unlikely to say “this whole chunk of code does a disservice to the user”. Someone needs to be focused on optimizing those things, and they need to be persuasive.</p>

<p>Make your design hire about not just <a href="http://brintmontgomery.blogspot.com/2010/01/taste-as-defined-by-steve-jobs.html">taste</a> (which is critical) but for their ability to articulate the user’s point of view. And put them in a position to argue.</p>
