<div class="post-content"><p>I was at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ny-tech/events/47879702/">PIPA/SOPA protest</a> in front of the offices of Senators Schumer and Gillibrand today. All fine and good, but why should the senators care?</p>

<p>The immediate answer is, they won’t…but bear with me.</p>

<p>These senators, like others, succeed because they are able to <strong>monetize their influence</strong>. This means that they expect would-be influencers — like, say, the entertainment or technology or finance industries — to put their money where their mouths are. And historically, <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=2012&amp;amp;cid=n00001093&amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;newmem=N">they</a> <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=2012&amp;amp;cid=n00027658&amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;newmem=N">have</a>.</p>

<p>The senators are accustomed — indeed their careers are based on — having interested parties donate in $$ amounts proportional to the legislative consideration they expect.</p>

<p>But what if the tech industry were able to <strong>radically reprice political influence</strong>? What if we were able to have the same influence of (say) the entertainment industry, at (say) 1/10th of the cost?</p>

<p>This idea frightens legacy politicians as much as the web frightens local newspapers. They are accustomed to being the only game in town, with a captive customer and a strong negotiating position. When the <a href="/2011/12/19/please-dont-lobby/">pricing floor drops out</a>, the legacy business becomes much less important while the consumer receives a better product.</p>

<p>In other words, please don’t lobby. Disrupt.</p>
