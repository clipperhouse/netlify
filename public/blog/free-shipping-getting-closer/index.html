(No, it’s not neutral but of course, I think that’s <a href="http://clipperhouse.com/2008/03/01/the-biggest-threat-to-your-rights-scarcity/">fine</a>.)</p>

<p>What right now looks like preferential <em>economic</em> treatment to an incumbent’s preferred bits is in fact setting the stage for putting such treatment up for sale. Mind you, the network won’t treat, say, iTunes’ <em>actual bits</em> any differently than anyone else’s. They’ll get delivered just like they are now.</p>

<p>However, it will be in iTunes’ (and Netflix’s and ESPN’s) interest to ensure that end users feel free to consume their services. Which means that these content providers will want to make a deal with AT&amp;T (and Comcast etc) such that delivery of their videos and songs <strong>do not count against a user’s bandwidth limits</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s <strong>free shipping</strong>. Get a video from us and we pay the delivery. Really, it’s what Netflix is doing already.</p>

<p>Consumers’ bandwidth is subsidized by the content providers. The network providers get paid for building pipes.</p>

<p>It’s more expensive for content providers, but only if they choose to play. And they’ll play if one of their competitors does it first. It’s called competing on price.</p>

<p>The brilliance is that there is no non-neutral behavior by the ISPs. They deliver the bits regardless. Nothing is blocked or slowed. What changes is who pays.</p>

<p>The only way this violates net neutrality is if we further expand the already-squirrely definition.</p>
