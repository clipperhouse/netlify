  <p>Just experimenting a bit with using <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">Windows Live Writer</a> as a publishing tool for <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine.Net</a>.

<p>That’s a local app you are looking at above, not this web site. After putting a screen shot in my post, it looks like a mirror reflecting a mirror. :)</p>

<p>The upside of using a local program for editing is faster saving of drafts plus nice conveniences like spell-checking. (I find the WYSIWYG editor in BlogEngine to be a little wonky, as such things often are.)</p>
