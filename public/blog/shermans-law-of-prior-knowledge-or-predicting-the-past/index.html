<h4 id="when-a-disaster-happens-large-or-small-there-is-a-100-chance-that-a-headline-will-be-written-claiming-ignored-warnings">“When a disaster happens, large or small, there is a 100% chance that a headline will be written claiming ignored warnings.”</h4>

<p>I’ve come to realize, that’s the narrative. It’s always the narrative, and the details of the incident matter little.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-15/apple-engineer-said-to-have-told-jobs-last-year-about-iphone-antenna-flaw.html">Apple Engineer Told Jobs IPhone Antenna Might Cut Calls</a></p>

<p><a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/natural_resources/article7114087.ece">BP warned of rig fault ten years ago</a></p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=90453&amp;amp;page=1">Bush Warned of Hijackings Before <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub></a></p>

<p>…etc. It’s not that any of these folks are blameless. It’s that, in all likelihood, they acted like you and I and everyone else would.</p>

<p>And we (they) have to. If we responded to everything that might be a disaster, we’d never leave the house. Did you read every street sign, every warning label today? Every word of every email you were sent?</p>

<p>Your life is full of possible disasters. It’s just that 99.9% of them won’t come to pass, and your only choice is to make the best of incomplete information. Remember, useless panic and irrational caution have costs.</p>

<p>After the fact, however, we need a story. It’s called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb#Epistemology_and_theories_of_randomness">narrative fallacy</a>. If we can imagine incompetent people taking reckless chances, then disasters start to make sense.</p>

<p>But making sense is not something that most disasters do. Which is called the ludic fallacy — that probabilities tell us something, and that these things in the past were predictable.</p>

<p>And yet that assertion is self-refuting. Why? Because we didn’t predict it.</p>

<p>Sure, <em>someone</em> did. But you’ll only find out who in retrospect.</p>
