<p>I’ve come to realize, that’s the narrative. It’s always the narrative, and the details of the incident matter little.</p>

<p>…etc. It’s not that any of these folks are blameless. It’s that, in all likelihood, they acted like you and I and everyone else would.</p>

<p>And we (they) have to. If we responded to everything that might be a disaster, we’d never leave the house. Did you read every street sign, every warning label today? Every word of every email you were sent?</p>

<p>Your life is full of possible disasters. It’s just that 99.9% of them won’t come to pass, and your only choice is to make the best of incomplete information. Remember, useless panic and irrational caution have costs.</p>

<p>After the fact, however, we need a story. It’s called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb#Epistemology_and_theories_of_randomness">narrative fallacy</a>. If we can imagine incompetent people taking reckless chances, then disasters start to make sense.</p>

<p>But making sense is not something that most disasters do. Which is called the ludic fallacy — that probabilities tell us something, and that these things in the past were predictable.</p>

<p>And yet that assertion is self-refuting. Why? Because we didn’t predict it.</p>

<p>Sure, <em>someone</em> did. But you’ll only find out who in retrospect.</p>
