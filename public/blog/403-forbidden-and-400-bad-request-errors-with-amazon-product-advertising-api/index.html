    <main class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I recently experienced an issue using the Amazon Product Advertising API (formerly the Amazon Associates Web Service). I was getting a “403 Forbidden” error for what seemed like a normal request.</p>

<p>I am using the sample C# code provided <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=2480&amp;amp;categoryID=14">here</a>, along with the Amazon.ECS library (which apparently is no longer supported by Amazon).</p>

<p>I was doing an ItemSearchRequest, with a search term of “black swan”.</p>

<p>I tracked the error down to the encoding of the search terms. They were being passed with the URL encoding, so the querystring became “black+swan”. This is apparently no longer supported — you must use percent-style encoding. By using “black%20swan” instead, it worked.</p>

<p>This is caused by a bug in the sample code at the link above. Line 142 of SignedRequestHelper.cs reads:
<code>str.Replace(&amp;#34;&amp;#39;&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;%27&amp;#34;).Replace(&amp;#34;(&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;%28&amp;#34;).Replace(&amp;#34;)&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;%29&amp;#34;)  
   .Replace(&amp;#34;*&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;%2A&amp;#34;).Replace(&amp;#34;!&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;%21&amp;#34;).Replace(&amp;#34;%7e&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;~&amp;#34;).Replace(&amp;#34;+&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;%20&amp;#34;);</code></p>

<p>It needs to read:
<code>str = str.Replace(&amp;#34;&amp;#39;&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;%27&amp;#34;).Replace(&amp;#34;(&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;%28&amp;#34;).Replace(&amp;#34;)&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;%29&amp;#34;)  
         .Replace(&amp;#34;*&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;%2A&amp;#34;).Replace(&amp;#34;!&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;%21&amp;#34;).Replace(&amp;#34;%7e&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;~&amp;#34;).Replace(&amp;#34;+&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;%20&amp;#34;);</code></p>

<p>Someone forgot that strings are <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2008/01/13/immutable-types-understand-them-and-use-them.aspx">immutable</a>!</p>

<p>By the way, I was making changes because Amazon has a <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/ann.jspa?annID=444">new security requirement</a> for this API. If you would like some help/code in adapting to the updated API, <a href="/blog/Contact.aspx">drop me a note</a>.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>While I’m in the neighborhood, I also had to deal with a “400 Bad Request” error.</p>

<p>Part of the new API authentication scheme is a timestamp. The clock on my server had fallen quite a ways behind — it hadn’t been synced in a while. This resulted in an inaccurate timestamp on the request, and Amazon rejected it.</p>

<p>After correcting the server’s clock, it worked fine.</p>
