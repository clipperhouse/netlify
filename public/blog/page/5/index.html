    <h2 class="post-title">Multi-credentialing</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">John Maeda of RISD has a riff about the future of college credentials, including the notion of an automated ‘degree’, which is generated by a machine based on the sum your achievements. He makes an analogy to Coinstar: pour in a bunch of individually valuable stuff, get out some paper which aggregates its value.
It’s not that crazy of an idea; it only sounds crazy because we are using our current terminology of credentials as a certificate of education....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Progress bars cannot be accurate</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">We all see progress bars and some of us even implement them. And we’ve all seen how hilariously wrong they can be. There’s a reason for that.
In order for a progress bar to be accurate, a program needs to determine how long it will take to run, prior to running it. It needs to know how much work it will do before doing it.
It seems to me that the only way to accurately know how much work a program has to do, is to do the work....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Your site doesn’t need a novel progress indicator</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">There’s been healthy talk about progress indicators in the age of ajax. In our will-to-design I think some things are being missed.
First, your browser’s UI already includes a progress indicator, and perhaps more than one:
Your user is accustomed to these things, not unlike the back button. Why would we introduce a novel UI element, adding to the user’s cognitive load, when we already have them?
The shortcoming here is that, perhaps, the browser doesn’t offer obvious programmatic access to the above, or that it doesn’t occur to us to use it....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Language and social signaling</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I like language. I came to it causally at first, and more formally of late.
I’ve always been amused by out-of-fashion terminology (I say “good lord” a lot) and like the feeling of choosing words a bit differently than others might.
Expressing things wrongly, or inserting ignorant-sounding bits, is fun. I regularly say “the rock and roll” or “the YouTube” because it’s funny and evokes an old-timey ignorance. (It also expresses a bit of humility: comparing what I know to what is knowable about music and the Internet, I am an old-timey ignoramus....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">1.6% of what?</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">The NSA has published a paper claiming that it “touches” only 1.6% of Internet traffic. Now, 1.6% of something the size of the Internet is already enormous, but let’s demonstrate that the number represents are much larger share of human communications than one might intuit.
First, let’s assume that the NSA is interested only in “novel” traffic — human-created, unique data that depicts an individual’s activities or intentions.
My assumption is that the NSA is not interested in inspecting the actual bits that comprise Arrested Development or a cat video; it’s precisely the same data being transferred over and over, month after month....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Incidence of compulsion</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">This is an encouraging story about Google exploring the ability to encrypt ‘sitting files’ in their Google Drive product. This is distinct from something like SSL, which only protects items in transit; most companies store the canonical file in the clear.
Declan mentions problem #1, which is that encrypted files are hard to search, and search is Google’s thing. Take that away, and the product is devalued.
What is less thoroughly explored is that, for the government to actually be impeded in retrieving your files, Google would have to be legitimately ignorant of your key....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">This study that Google conducted to find predictors for success in their hiring process is very interesting. Among the things that are not predictive of success: the candidate’s GPA, their ability to solve brain-teasers, and which manager did the interview.
The hiring process is very difficult. It’s largely intuitive and we make decisions based on personal heuristics. All of which is okay — in fact, we don’t have much of a choice, since actual predictors are hard to come by....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">OCD is id, high standards are ego</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">As programmers, we have a powerful tool that we deploy often: OCD.
While the name connotes a ‘disorder’, certain obsessive behaviors make for very effective programmers. Remember, code that is 99% right is wrong. Crashingly, money-losingly wrong. OCD is made for this profession.
Its strength, however, is also its weakness: it monopolizes our attention. Our ability to dive deep, to focus, to simply not let things go, makes for amazing code and terrible time management....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I played with iOS7 today for a bit and discussed the flat design with a couple of Stack’ers. I also read Matt Gemmell’s review, and John Gruber’s take on flatness.
The unifying sentiment seems to be: in the early days of smartphones (say 2007), buttons needed to look like buttons so we know where to click. Since then, we’ve all become familiar with the idea of tapping icons, so perhaps we don’t need to make the affordances quite so obvious....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">For want of parens in Ruby</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Ruby is beautiful in many ways. The opportunities to create tight, readable code are impressive. More than other languages, it affords the opportunity to make code look like what it does.
One syntactic wart, however, is functions. I’ll make an analogy with JavaScript, where myFunction()
executes myFunction, while myFunction
is a variable that refers to the function, that can be passed as, say, a callback. In Ruby, parentheses around method arguments are optional, such that my_thing....</p>
