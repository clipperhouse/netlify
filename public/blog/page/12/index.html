  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I find it is so funny and ironic when a person has to tell you they are telling the truth before they tell you the true thing that is truthful. Today, as part of a otherwise interesting and opinionated post, we learn: I try to be a totally dispassionate truth teller.
Um, who doesn’t? I assume that when any person writes something, they believe themselves to be telling the truth, or offering an honest opinion....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Please don’t write “efficient” CSS</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Contra many smart people, I am going to make a contrarian request: please do not attempt to optimize your CSS for performance. Instead, please optimize for correctness, specificity and maintainability.
A quick bit of philosophical background. CSS is a declarative language, not unlike HTML and (basic) SQL. It is designed to describe what you want, but not how to execute it. Thus, declarative languages have no verbs — only nouns and adjectives....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">A while back I mentioned the idea that some content sites would offer free shipping for their bits. It would be the inevitable result of metered pricing on the Internet, an idea with which major (wired) carriers are experimenting.
For example, ESPN might make a deal with Comcast to say “any video from ESPN flowing over Comcast’s network will not count against the customer’s bandwidth bill.” Basically, ESPN becomes toll-free for the customer, not unlike an 800 number....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I feel like I’ve been hearing about Flash 10.1 forever. The earliest public announcement I can find is October 5 of last year. That’s over 6 months of development for a point release.
Which is entirely understandable — it’s a “maintenance” release, in the sense that most of the goodness is under the covers. Hardware acceleration, better mobile, more platforms. Sounds like it will fix a lot of performance and reliability problems....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">There has been some fun stuff today following Steve Jobs missive on Flash and standards. Joe Hewitt (former Facebook and Mozilla dev and rock star): How it should go: browsers innovate differently, users pick the best one, later W3C standardizes what users chose, losing browsers conform.
Sachin: Browsers aren’t innovating. They are just trying to comply with standards and fix bugs and performance
 Right now browser updates fix bugs and add application features, but can’t enhance the functionality of the web....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I wanted to randomize the display of a List on my site — meaning I would retrieve (say) 20 records, but display only 5, chosen at random. I was imagining a loop that generates a bunch of random indexes, which I use to individually pull elements from the list. Yuck.
The solution I found is much more elegant — two lines! To randomize your list, simply: var rnd = new Random();...</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Epistemology in everyday life</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">In school, (cough) years ago, I did a bit of epistemology. It’s the study of knowledge. It asks the questions “why do we know that?” and “how will we find that out?”.
It’s infused through everything we do, we just might not realize it. A couple of practical examples.
Markets
One big difference between left and right is trust in markets. The left will say “here is what we need, now how do we get markets (people) to go there?...</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Dear tech journalists: please announce a one-year, self-imposed Apple embargo</h2>

  <p class="post-summary">San Mateo county police, presumably at the bidding of Apple, broke open the front the door of the home of the editor of a technology blog and seized his property. This is in relation to Gizmodo’s revelation of what is presumed to be the next iPhone.
On its merits, Gizmodo may well have broken the law. However, this incident is over a tech gadget, not some explosive device or human trafficking....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">We’ve begun implementing some of Facebook’s Open Graph on Alikewise, my dating startup. By Dare Obasanjo’s definition, books are our main “social object”.
(The site is based around the idea that a person will associate themselves with any number of books, with the hope that this will inspire notice by other singles.)
Indeed, the Open Graph protocol is a step toward a more semantic web by allowing us to put agreed-upon metadata into our pages....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">“No carry-on fees” simply means everyone pays carry-on fees</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I can’t imagine why Congress is involved in this, but apparently it’s an outrage that airlines are charging fees for carry-on bags.
The fallacy is that by banning such fees, the consumer is saved money. In fact, it’s the opposite.
Since all passengers will be allowed to carry-on without a separate fee, that fee will simply be built into every ticket, regardless of whether the traveler actually takes a carry-on. Instead of no one paying, everyone does....</p>
