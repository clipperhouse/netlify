      I wrote earlier about how Windows running on Mac hardware via Boot Camp appears to have serious battery-life issues — getting only around 2 hours of life on a machine that should offer at least twice that.
I speculated there was some sort of proprietary DRM-ish hardware layer that Windows was fighting against, but commenters thought that that the ACPI power profile that Apple offers is not sufficient. In any case, it seems consistent across all Windows versions on Mac hardware.

      I recently purchased a new iPhone 3GS since my previous phone bit the dust (or pavement, more accurately). I went to order online via AT&amp;T, and was surprised to find out the tax on a $199 phone was $56, or over 25%. Wha? I went to make the same purchase at Apple’s online store, and found the same thing.
Then I decided to just mosey down to the nearby (physical) Apple store — and of course the tax was the same.

      This article over a TechCrunch is putatively about the iPhone, but the take-away for me is that AT&amp;T’s data traffic has grown 50-fold over the last 3 years:
(Slide is by Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley)
It’s easy to complain about AT&amp;T’s network, etc, because people like to bitch. But I am not aware of any data service that has ever scaled up that quickly.
And one wonders what Verizon’s aggregate data traffic looks like.

      I love the language of Mozilla VP Mike Shaver’s non-retraction retraction regarding a Microsoft plugin for Firefox: We received confirmation from Microsoft this evening that the Framework Assistant add-on is not a mechanism for exploiting the vulnerabilities detailed in the earlier post, so we’ve removed it from the blocklist.
Hee hee. In other words, there was not a security vulnerability, although we stated unequivocally that there was, and others quickly parroted same.

I got to thinking about the word medium. We talk about medium as in, I’ll have a medium soda. We also talk about media like radio and television. Different meanings, right?

      I’ve written a few times why solid-state hard drives (SSDs) are a sea change, similar to our transition from CRT to LCD a few years ago.
Anandtech gets it right in an exhaustive analysis of why this is so. The biggest problem with traditional (spinning) hard drives is not simply raw speed — it’s that they are sequential.
Many traditional drives can do high-throughput when you benchmark them. And that’s all well and good.

      Apparently, Facebook is running around 30,000 physical servers. That hurts my head. With 300,000,000 users, that translates to around 10,000 users per server. They are doing (back-of-the-envelope) ~4.2 billion pageviews/day. Each server, then, is doing around 140,000 page views per day.
What Facebook is doing is especially hard: nearly every page that you view on the site is generated fresh just for you, and needs to know about new changes from any one of your dozens or hundreds of friends.

      Rick Strahl has a nice solution for mitigating the n+1 problem in Linq to SQL. The n+1 problem is a situation where, as you iterate over a set of query results in a list view, one or more additional database queries are fired for each row in the list. Since database calls are relatively expensive, you want to keep these to a minimum.
Things like Linq to SQL make this an easy mistake to make.

      I dig my iPhone, but when I switched over from my Blackberry, I was very surprised at how many steps it takes to find out about new email.
On the Blackberry, there is an external light that flashes a different color based on new messages. Then, when you log in to the BB home screen, the Messages icon has a little badge indicating new messages, also by color. So either one or zero interactions is enough.

      Apple is not really a partnering company. They make their own hardware and software — and services like .Mac Mobile Me — to ensure a certain user experience. This is their offer, and it works.
When Apple partnered with AT&amp;T to release the iPhone, this was an unusual ceding of control on Apple’s part. They couldn’t build a phone network, of course, and that business is probably a bit old-school and low-margin for stylie Apple.
