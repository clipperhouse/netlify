  <p class="post-summary">I love how Vista offers me so many choices in getting on the interwebs. I can:
 Connect to a network Manage wireless networks Set up a connection or network Manage network connections  I can do this by first going to Network and Internet, and then to the Network and Sharing Center. So far, there are 6 “network” places that might do what I need. There’s also a Network item in the Start Menu which is something else....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Google as censor? Of course.</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Daniel Indiviglio semi-condemns Google for its compliance with Chinese censorship laws. The “condemnation” is that they put profits before ethics. But that’s way too simplistic and strikes me as a bit insincere — as if we are shocked that Google is trying to make money.
Google is strategically smart to comply with the Chinese government, just as they comply with laws here in the US. Of course they are pursuing profits....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Use case: SSL and email</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Interesting article in the NYT about using SSL for email. It’s an option for Gmail which I turned on some time ago.
Eric Schmidt mentions that the (potential) downside of SSL is performance — your computer and the email service need to encrypt and decrypt data for every operation. That’s work. But does it matter to humans?
Let’s do the use case: how do we use email? Of all the applications we use on the internet, I would argue that email is the least real-time of all of them....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Imagine CSS evolved as a programming language</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I’ve gotten reasonably good with CSS, but I often find myself feeling that certain concepts are conflated or a bit ad hoc.
CSS does two separate things:
 Defines a set of visual attributes as a “style” Specifies the DOM elements to which those styles are to be applied  These are different ideas, IMHO. For example, I’d like to define a color palette in once place, and then apply it in different ways throughout in my style library....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">“Built-in” jQuery (and how IE can get some dev cred)</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I’ve mentioned in the past that jQuery is an API as much as it is a set of functions. As syntaxes go, it’s very nice — consistent, logical, readable.
What are the chances that one of the browser makers will announce “native” support for jQuery in their next version? What would this even mean?
Well, for starters, I think it would mean that the jQuery selector syntax would be understood by the browser as a DOM query language....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Phil Haack has a nice exploration of what it means to “program”. As long as I’ve been doing this — since the early 90’s — there has always been the promise that “programming” will go away. This usually takes the form of visual tools that offer the ability to drag-and-drop the logical chunks of your programs together.
This is to say, we are continually promised the holy grail of declarative programming....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">64-bitness: what it is and what it ain’t</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Very interesting post from Rico Mariani on the why’s and why-not’s of doing 64-bit applications, specifically Visual Studio. It’s important to understand that Visual Studio is about manipulating code, not the data that your code will ultimately handle.
This implies that, in order to truly exploit 64-bit, your program itself would need to be 4 gigabytes in size or larger.
Photoshop will benefit from keeping a massive image file in memory....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">The cloud! The cloud!</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Everything in technology is an abstraction of something else. The browser is an abstraction, the keyboard is an abstraction, C# is an abstraction; they all sit on top of other things and hide the details, with the goal of making you productive. (And each of those layers is actually comprised of many substrata.)
An abstraction is successful when we no longer need to look under the covers. It takes a while to get to that point....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Dave Ward has a very extensive post (with benchmarks) on jQuery selector optimization. Really interesting stuff — the lesson is, the more specific your query, the faster it executes. The DOM is a data source, after all. He was able to achieve a 10x performance improvement by adding just 11 characters....</p>
