  I’ve seen it argued that a measure of a good programmer is the amount of “stuff” they can keep in their head at one time.
I don’t mean simple memory — I mean that they can retain a larger mental map of what’s going on. They see more of the dependencies and relationships and elements of their project at once, which allows them to write better code and track down issues more quickly.

  Some folks are putting forward theories that the new health bill will increase entrepreneurship in the US, as individuals are freed from reliance on large employers for health care. I think the theory is both wishful and unempirical.
The glib (but correct) answer is that, if this were true, Silicon Valley would be in Europe.
The longer answer is that the theory is myopic; it looks at a very small part of the picture.

  In the arguments over net neutrality, the discussion is often around “content” vs “delivery”. The concern is that the delivery people (ISPs) might cut off or otherwise extort the content people. Eg, what if Comcast slowed down YouTube so it could push its own video?
It’s a distinction that exists only in the mind. In the real world, the boundary between content and network is both artificial and fading quickly: …if Google were an ISP it would be the third largest in the world and the fastest growing — if you are measuring the amount of traffic passed from its network to another.

  It would appear that jQuery (1.4.2) is not compatible with the new IE9 preview:
Looks like the .ready() and .live() events are throwing errors. Anyone else?
With IE9’s focus on CSS selectors, I am hoping for some jQuery optimizations — those selectors are a lot like jQ’s so I wonder if a native API will be exposed to use the “native” selector engine.

  This article asks if programming is the new literacy: …we have in a sense returned to the Middle Ages or ancient Egypt, or even before. Then, if you needed to communicate your thoughts on paper, you couldn’t do it yourself. You had to hire a better-educated person — a scribe — who knew the writing code. Then, at the other end, you needed someone to read or decode it — unless, of course, you were “well educated,” that is, you had been taught to read and write and thus had become literate.

  Here’s an idiom that I think would be useful in C#: “property methods” in the style of jQuery.
There are many methods in jQ — html(), val(), width() — that are getters when they are called without an argument, and setters when they are. This makes for some very nice fluent code: $(“#someElement”).width(“100px”).html(“hello there”);
window.alert(“The width of #someElement is ” + $(“#someElement”).width());
I’d love to be able to do this in C#, to bring in some of that fluency and terseness.

  Progressive Enhancement is a methodology where a web application is developed in layers. Each layer works correctly on its own, and additional layers on top enhance the user experience.
The justifications for Progressive Enhancement are usually around graceful degradation — people using older technologies are not left out in the cold, while better technologies are exploited for more cutting edge users.
Those are fine things, but there are more compelling reasons to use PE, in my opinion.

  I recently had a chat with a peer/CTO-type who has argued before Congress a local board on net neutrality. Got me thinking again. Even though I made these arguments in the mid 00’s (in a more, um, polemic venue) I thought it might be worth revisiting.
The idea of legislating the flow of bits over the Internet strikes me as saying, we like the Internet the way it is now, please don’t let it change.

  We have January browser numbers. Firstly, we note that Internet Explorer 8 is now the most popular browser, overtaking IE6.
“Modern browsers”, as previously defined, are now around 60% of the market. Chrome (my fave) gained 0.57 percentage points, which represents a 12% gain in user base.
Firefox stayed approximately even, with a slight downward trend, for the second month in a row.
IE6’s trend of loss leveled off a little bit, to 0.

  Today, Google announced that it will begin phasing out support on older browsers, most notably IE6, for Google Docs. It will take this step with Gmail and Calendar later in the year. This is a big step.
There has been much debate about the best way to handle browser obsolescence. On the one had, newer browsers offer a great improvement in user experience and web application capabilities. On the other hand, many people continue to use old browsers, largely because they don’t have other options.
