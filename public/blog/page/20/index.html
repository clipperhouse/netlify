    <h2 class="post-title">A thought experiment: serial vs parallel</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Now that solid-state drives are arriving in the mainstream, I’ve been thinking about the implications of serial vs parallel and how they affect overall perceived performance. And by “perceived” I mean, what does the client — both the technical and human variety — experience?
If the capacity of two systems is each (say) ten requests per hour, yet one is serial and one is parallel, can there be a net benefit for the user?...</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I noticed that syntax errors in my views were not being caught during the build process — instead I would find them at run-time when I actually hit the view.
This struck me as odd — certainly one would want to know about compilation errors at compile-time, no?
So I emailed ScottGu and he directed me to this helpful tip, with will do exactly the above:

Scott (and the author of the above) warn that this will slow down builds....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Your bottleneck is you, or, why I’ve stopped worrying about performance</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Provocative headline, no? Let me explain.
Like Jeff Atwood, I consider end-user performance to be a feature. Pages should snap. It sends a very positive signal to customers, IMHO. And the site should snap with 10 or 10,000 users.
That said, as a developer I am learning to worry less about the little things when it comes to performance.
For example, I went to a SQL Server talk where they worried about how many disk spindles to split the load across....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Google acquired reCAPTCHA today, a company that provides a simple means of adding a spam-limiting mechanism to your site. (I’ve implemented it several times and I recommend it to clients.)
There are technologies where size matters more than others. One of them is spam-fighting.
Spam, whether in email or in the comments of a blog, is fought with data. It is a statistical game — lots of very fast computers doing their best to ask, how much does this message resemble spam?...</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Intel first announced its second generation consumer solid-state drives on July 21. There were plenty of positive reviews at the time, and the price drop combined with better performance made me ready to take the plunge.
A few days later, a defect was found. Intel has historically done a good job of issuing patches, so I assumed that a firmware fix would not be a big deal. But then they disappeared from store shelves (by which I mean e-tailers like Amazon and NewEgg)....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">So, I was looking around for a simple way to emulate the “Publish” function of Visual Studio for my first ASP.net MVC project.
I am doing my builds on a server with CruiseControl.Net. Google led me to things like msdeploy, which I am sure is great, but really I shouldn’t need another tool.
I need two steps implemented as simply as possible:
 Build it Move the built project to directory that IIS points to — but only the required files  The build step is straightforward and familiar to those who use CC: the MsBuild Task....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">There are only a small number of sites in the world that require truly tremendous scale. Usually, this is referred to as “web scale”, and describes a site where the data is user-generated and highly dynamic. Among the first that come to mind are Facebook, Digg, MySpace and the like.
Once you get to that scale, the rules of building a site become counter-intuitive to what most of us know....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">The “var” thing</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I’ve come to really enjoy using the “var” keyword in C#. Although it’s been written about many times, I want to clarify what it is.
C# is a strongly-typed language, which means that every variable you declare must have a specified type. You must say it’s an integer or a string or a Thing. “var” does not change that.
“var” looks a lot like the var in Javascript. Javascript is not strongly-typed, so you don’t have to say what “x” represents....</p>
