  Now that solid-state drives are arriving in the mainstream, I’ve been thinking about the implications of serial vs parallel and how they affect overall perceived performance. And by “perceived” I mean, what does the client — both the technical and human variety — experience?
If the capacity of two systems is each (say) ten requests per hour, yet one is serial and one is parallel, can there be a net benefit for the user?

  I noticed that syntax errors in my views were not being caught during the build process — instead I would find them at run-time when I actually hit the view.
This struck me as odd — certainly one would want to know about compilation errors at compile-time, no?
So I emailed ScottGu and he directed me to this helpful tip, with will do exactly the above:
http://devermind.com/aspnet/aspnet-mvc-tip-turn-on-compile-time-view-checking/
Scott (and the author of the above) warn that this will slow down builds.

  Provocative headline, no? Let me explain.
Like Jeff Atwood, I consider end-user performance to be a feature. Pages should snap. It sends a very positive signal to customers, IMHO. And the site should snap with 10 or 10,000 users.
That said, as a developer I am learning to worry less about the little things when it comes to performance.
For example, I went to a SQL Server talk where they worried about how many disk spindles to split the load across.

  I navigated on my computer to the web site called “The dullest blog in the world”. I was mildly amused for several minutes. After which, I visited other web sites.

  Google acquired reCAPTCHA today, a company that provides a simple means of adding a spam-limiting mechanism to your site. (I’ve implemented it several times and I recommend it to clients.)
There are technologies where size matters more than others. One of them is spam-fighting.
Spam, whether in email or in the comments of a blog, is fought with data. It is a statistical game — lots of very fast computers doing their best to ask, how much does this message resemble spam?

  Intel first announced its second generation consumer solid-state drives on July 21. There were plenty of positive reviews at the time, and the price drop combined with better performance made me ready to take the plunge.
A few days later, a defect was found. Intel has historically done a good job of issuing patches, so I assumed that a firmware fix would not be a big deal. But then they disappeared from store shelves (by which I mean e-tailers like Amazon and NewEgg).

  For fabulous prizes, or perhaps a hearty attaboy, the question is:
People are throwing things at you and yelling “horn high yo”. Who are you, and what are they asking you to do?
No Googling! Honor system. Please answer in the comments below.

  So, I was looking around for a simple way to emulate the “Publish” function of Visual Studio for my first ASP.net MVC project.
I am doing my builds on a server with CruiseControl.Net. Google led me to things like msdeploy, which I am sure is great, but really I shouldn’t need another tool.
I need two steps implemented as simply as possible:
 Build it Move the built project to directory that IIS points to — but only the required files  The build step is straightforward and familiar to those who use CC: the MsBuild Task.

  There are only a small number of sites in the world that require truly tremendous scale. Usually, this is referred to as “web scale”, and describes a site where the data is user-generated and highly dynamic. Among the first that come to mind are Facebook, Digg, MySpace and the like.
Once you get to that scale, the rules of building a site become counter-intuitive to what most of us know.

  I’ve come to really enjoy using the “var” keyword in C#. Although it’s been written about many times, I want to clarify what it is.
C# is a strongly-typed language, which means that every variable you declare must have a specified type. You must say it’s an integer or a string or a Thing. “var” does not change that.
“var” looks a lot like the var in Javascript. Javascript is not strongly-typed, so you don’t have to say what “x” represents.
