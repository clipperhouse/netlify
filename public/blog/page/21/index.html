  Oh right…bollocks. This report seems to be circulating that “Braidwood”, Intel’s inexpensive flash-memory-disk-cache-helper-outer, will somehow negate demand for full-blown SSDs (solid-state drives).
Bollocks. Sure, Braidwood sounds like it might be useful but it’s a wedge. It’s a shim. It’s a little add-on that will offer a nice incremental performance boost for a few dollars.
SSDs, in my opinion, are a sea change that’s waiting to happen. They are about 10x faster than the “spinning rust” that comprises a traditional hard drive.

  I am one of the many people who have fallen in love with jQuery over the past year or two. I haven’t seen it articulated why this might be, so here’s my stab at it.
Many programmers I know are server-oriented. They consider dealing with HTML and Javascript a chore. Those client-side things are sloppy, loose and hard to predict. We patch them together as best we can, and cross fingers.

  Alright, today’s geek question relates to branding:
Which company trademarked the brand name “Heroin”?
Bonus: under what circumstances did they lose that trademark?
No Googling! Honor system ‘round here. Answer in the comments.
—
A couple of hints. Happened over 100 years ago. The company invented and owned the trademark for another common drug that’s sitting in your medicine cabinet right now, and lost that trademark for the same reason.

  Chris Dixon points out that the challenge in “artificial intelligence” — which in a mainstream definition would be “making computers learn like humans” — is not so much the cleverness of the algorithm but in finding useful data. He cites the Google example where the breakthrough was realizing that links are a good (and previously untapped) source of data on what people think is a relevant web page. Modern AI algorithms are very powerful, but the reality is there are thousands of programmers/researchers who can implement them with about the same level of success.

  Tech blogging shall resume shortly.
So, it was 90+ degrees in NY and I went for a run. I’ve never perspired that much in my life. On the walk back to where I was staying, I stopped in a barber shop and said “how much to take it off”?
$16. Wow, that’s cheap. The place did a proper job and even shaved my neck with a straight blade.
They’re called Reamir and apparently they have several locations in Manhattan.

  OK, I might or might not give out a prize like last time. Times are tight, y’know. Impress me and we’ll see. The question is:
What is the difference between a meteor and a meteorite?
Bonus points for describing what the term “meteor” refers to, precisely.
No Googling! Honor system. Please answer in the comments.

Update: Russ is a winner! I believe that meteor specifically refers to the streak of light in the sky, as opposed to the object itself.

  Microsoft announced pricing for its upcoming Zune HD today, coming around 25% below the prices of equivalent iPod Touches. I wondered if Microsoft is making any money at such prices — after all, it’s based on a fancy new chip and has other nice specs.
Then it occurred to me that perhaps Microsoft has room to lose money on the hardware. If customers buy the Zune subscription music service, MS will be taking in around $15/mo after the initial sale.

  I was amused by this article’s title. So I’ve decided to compile clever expressions for “dead”. Tell me your faves in the comments below. I’ll update this page with the best ones.

  The upcoming Zune HD sounds pretty nice. I use my iPhone less as a recorded music device and more like a radio. I listen to podcasts or Pandora. Honestly, in the age of subscription media I have no interest in buying-and-syncing music.
Unlike the iPhone, the new Zune will come with an HD Radio tuner. Here’s the opportunity.
I’d love it if my Zune recorded radio like a Tivo. When I go out for a run, or get on the plane, I can just browse whatever has been queued up — or listen live.
