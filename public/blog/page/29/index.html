    <h2 class="post-title">Regulation, incumbency, haves and have-nots</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">When we talk about regulations, in housing or agriculture or the Internet, it is usually sold as being intended to protect some “little guy” — be it the “family farm” or the file sharer. The insight that is most lacking is that regulations often have the opposite effect, which is to weaken consumers, the poor, or the upstart competitor.
In other words, regulations aimed at Goliath too often hit David. Case in point is a new study in Seattle where housing regulations intended to “preserve character” have driven prices up dramatically: An intriguing new analysis by a University of Washington economics professor argues that home prices have, perhaps inadvertently, been driven up $200,000 by good intentions....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Whenever I see a new ad for a product or industry, I am relieved and encouraged. Why? Isn’t advertising the most crass, manipulative expression of our capitalist system?
Yes. But more than that, it is a plea to the consumer. And this is a good thing.
You see, when a company advertises, it indicates that they need us. That they have reason to plead their case directly to the consumers, aka the individual citizen....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Internet diversity &amp; cut cables Following on to my previous post that multiple broadband strategies are better than a single one, we’ve been hearing quite a bit about cut cables in the Middle East and India. While not perfectly analagous to our domestic infrastructure, these events point out a fundamental quality of the Internet: diversity.
While it’s easy to suppose that a “national broadband strategy” is desirable, in fact it is likely to make the Internet less diverse in terms of infrastructure....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">What we have are multiple broadband strategies; this is a good thing</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Over at Ars, the normally reasonable Nate misses the point on a national broadband strategy. He despairs over the fact that “we”, meaning the government, have no broadband strategy.
Actually, in the US, we have numerous broadband strategies. Verizon’s strategy is fiber to the home. AT&amp;T’s strategy is fiber to the node. Comcast’s strategy is DOCSIS 3.0. Sprint’s strategy is WiMax.
Each of these strategies is backed by highly incentivized companies, risking their own capital — not taxpayer’s....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Last week, Time-Warner announced that it is experimenting with metered Internet pricing in a couple of markets. The same week, HBO (owned by TW) announced that it will be offering a number of its shows free over the Internet to existing HBO cable subscribers.
Ars Technica notices what seems to be a bit of a contradiction: on one side, TW are sending lots of new data down the pipe in the form of HBO shows, while on the other side they are making it more expensive for such high-bandwidth applications....</p>
