    <h2 class="post-title">The iPhone needs multi-tasking, stat</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Joshua Topolsky offers a very funny and insightful take on the iPhone’s very fundamental flaw: it is designed for doing one thing at a time. […] my work requires that I use a bunch of web tools, look at lots of news sites, and have a feed reader open… basically, things that would require some level of multitasking. Imagine the frustration of having to constantly break the connection in chat to go look at a site or work on a post....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Is Wolfram Alpha too clever by half?</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">An excellent and exhaustive survey of Wolfram Alpha by Mencius Moldbug. I think he thinks like I do: an engineer that looks at user interface analytically.
That’s not as bad as it sounds. I have no visual design abilities myself, yet I know something about interface. It has to do with expectations.
MM’s critique is that Wolfram Alpha is a great tool with a fundamental mistake in its interface. The mistake is that it makes a promise it can’t achieve: For serious UI geeks, one way to see an intelligent control interface is as a false affordance — like a knob that cannot be turned, or a chair that cannot be sat in....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Google’s search market share in Europe is over 80%. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer — the target of repeated anti-trust charges by the EU — hovers under 50% in Europe.
By creating an operating system, it seems that Google is doing what monopolists are prohibited from doing: extending its dominance from one market to another. (Of course, Google’s new OS doesn’t exist yet and won’t have substantial market share for several years....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Can Google Chrome OS get traction?</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Google has pre-announced the “Google Chrome OS”. It’s intended as a lightweight operating system built primarily for hosting a browser.
The post is short on specifics, mostly mentioning goals. I think it sounds very attractive — I only write web apps these days and know very few people who don’t. But will it get traction?
I think out of the gate, it will be slow going. After all, if you (as a user) want to live on the web, you have that ability now....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">The new wave of self-shorteners</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">So, my previous bit on the attraction of shortening one’s own URLs seems to have some traction. Obviously it wasn’t original to me, but I see that sites like Ars Technica and Flickr have begun doing their own URL shortening. Check it out:
http://arst.ch/4fj
I had a similar notion a few weeks ago. In addition to shortening one’s own URLs, one might even use a shorter domain name that evokes the full name....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Identity theft boggles my mind a bit. It’s no mystery why criminal enterprises attempt it. It’s a mystery that we have systems where public information is used for security.
The biggest one is your Social Security Number. Why should knowledge of a person’s SSN entitle you to anything? The SSN is a user ID. A public key at best. It is certainly not a password.
And yet we use it as such....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Use case: the metric system, or, all that useless beauty</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Ah, nothing gets international rivalry boiling like soccer football and the metric system. One wonders why the metric system hasn’t taken off here in the US. I posit this: it doesn’t offer any advantage to end users, ie, regular citizens. Let’s do the use case.
Proponents of the metric system argue that it’s utterly logical. And it is; everything is decimal (base 10), so we can easily convert from grams to kilograms....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">More about {less}</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Raena Jackson Armitage offers an interesting exploration of LessCSS: I have a confession: I think parts of CSS suck. It’s repetitive, tedious, and … well, kind of dumb.
(Here are my previous comments.)
I wonder what it would take to work LESS into the CSS standard? The syntax seems intuitive and unambiguous, and feels like CSS. It’s a small evolution that would make a lot of people happy. I suspect the standards process is not so nimble....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I am not sure I’ve ever used the term “cyber” for anything, ever, but that’s the name given to those who squat on domain names. Here’s my story.
I am working on a startup and we are working to choose a name. We are lucky enough to have a friend who does naming professionally — that’s right — and she gave us a brainstormed list of 80&#43; possibilities. We picked our favorites and began polling our friends on their impressions....</p>
