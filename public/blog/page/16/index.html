  <p class="post-summary">This can’t be good:
Can servers really fail that spectacularly? I mean, yes of course they can but something running on RAID 5 should be recoverable. For this to happen, it would require a lot of neglect plus a healthy dose of bad luck. Yikes.

  <p class="post-summary">If Firefox were a stock, I’d be shorting it. That’s what I said a few months ago, too, and one of the Mozilla guys took issue.
I’ll say it again: what Firefox has is a user base, not a future. It’s not unlike Microsoft right now — their success is based on momentum, not new converts. (If Microsoft and Apple were to emerge from the womb today, who would win?)...</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">So, we all know that browsers have differing levels of CSS support. Working around them can be a pain in the a**, requiring non-standards-based hacks which are very hard to read and debug.
I’d like to write CSS that looks like this:
.ie div.thing
{
…some tweaks for IE…
}
.ff div.thing
{
…some tweaks for Firefox…
}
…etc. Even better:
.ie6 div.thing
{
…curse you old browser…
}
That’s readable, and isn’t polluted with the –moz stuff or &lt;!...</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Logic as data, and a case where strong typing impeded learning</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">These days, I am doing a lot of Javascript, or more accurately, a lot of jQuery. A concept I have gotten comfortable with is the idea of passing logic as data.
This article demonstrates a pattern to avoid brittle if-then statements. Instead of very long conditional branches, one encapsulates evaluation logic in a table of data. Each data item is a function containing an arbitrary piece of logic — code which runs after being passed to the main algorithm....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">{less} CSS for .Net</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">A while back I asked whether some enterprising-person-who-is-smarter-than-I would offer a version of the {less} CSS framework for .Net. Looks like they have, and they did it as I’d hoped: an HttpHandler mapped to the .less extension. So your .less files are compiled on the fly and served to the browser as plain ol’ CSS.
In brief, {less} is a syntax for CSS that allows for programmability and reusability. Define a color (or a whole set of CSS properties) in one place, and refer to them throughout....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">This is a gold mine for Joel and Jeff over at StackOverflow: careers. It’s something I thought of a while ago, and I am sure the SO guys were ahead of me by a millennium.
I think of markets in two main ways: robustness of information, and incentives.
On the information side, all the people who use StackOverflow have a great way to demonstrate their knowledge (or lack thereof). If an employer is interested in a candidate, they can view a (hopefully rich) history of their questions and answers to specific problems....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">My startup is developing a new web site, and every web developer must decide the extent to which they will support old technology — especially Internet Explorer 6.
From a technology perspective, officially supporting that browser could mean forgoing sexy features, or spending an inordinate amount of time working around the browser’s limitations and inconsistencies. You want your devs to spend their time making your site more compelling.
On the other hand, there are a lot of customers on IE6 whom you don’t want to alienate....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Why is Intel having so much trouble shipping its solid-state drives?</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I know I am getting repetitive but I have to ask again — why is Intel having so much trouble shipping its second-generation solid-state drives (the X25-M G2)?
A look around the web reveals that supplies are extremely constrained or non-existent. Amazon shows not in stock. NewEgg is sold out. Other smaller sellers at Amazon are showing inventory, but at prices well above MSRP — this indicates that these sellers are probably grasping at 1 or 2 units at a time....</p>
