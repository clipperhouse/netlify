    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I took a look at Google’s new language, Go. Some interesting stuff in there.
One idea in Go that would be especially handy in C# is implied interfaces. What does this mean?
Well, in C# you are accustomed to Interfaces. It’s a description of a type, without an implementation. I won’t go into why they are a good idea (think loose coupling).
A class (aka a Type) is said to satisfy an interface if it includes all the interface’s elements.

      So, an idea I have been kicking around a while is BillableHour.org. Would like to gather some feedback.
It’s a simple listing service for those who provide services that are billable by the hour. Such a person (or company) might be a lawyer, a programmer, or a gardener.
The monthly fee for listing on the site is your hourly rate. The proceeds go to a variety of charities, probably voted on by participants.

      There have been some interesting posts lately asking the question, “if some programmers are 10 times as productive as others, why aren’t they paid 10 times as much?”. It’s a good question, though I don’t think the recent posts quite get to the heart of it.
Some have said that it’s a sociological thing — that we, as a culture, generally don’t accept great disparities in pay. Within a mediocre organization, that might be true.

      AT&amp;T etc etc According to Gizmodo, AT&amp;T comes out #1 for data performance. My interest is two-fold. First, I get a geek thrill is watching networks getting built. Second, I have a pet peeve about the whole AT&amp;T-hating thing lately.
I really don’t care about loving or hating any particular company, and I find it so strange that others do. I think the ratio of people who are complaining about AT&amp;T, versus those that are having measurable issues, is about 100:1.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      An important concept in MVC is that Views are meant to be “dumb” — and by that I mean, your View should only care about outputting a user interface, and should know very little about business logic.
You want this for a few reasons. For example, you might create alternate Views for different kinds of output, such as for a mobile device. You shouldn’t have to re-implement any business logic to do that.

      So Fake Steve, who I like, thinks it would be funny to try to overload AT&amp;T network tomorrow. Which, fine, OK, but consider this.
This would be an act by a bunch of well-to-do people (the iPhone costs over $2000 over the life of your contract) against a bunch of other well-to-do people. You’re not sticking it to The Man; you are The Man.
You’re in a friggin’ chair in the sky.

      Very interesting (if-you’re-a-nerd) talk by John Resig. It’s real geek stuff but the takeaways are:
 John is very serious about testing, tracing and benchmarking for jQuery (and frameworks in general). For you and me, that means faster, more reliable jQuery. Win. (He also thinks many common benchmarks are bullshit not statistically sound.) jQuery 1.4 takes advantage of the above. He approaches performance more in terms of reducing complexity, as opposed to tweaking optimizations.

      I would love to see notebooks based on Nvidia’s insane Tegra chip:
The above can drive 720p HDMI output from a friggin’ handheld. The Zune HD uses one. So why not a notebook?
A friend recently got a netbook as a gift, and it’s cool, and it gets like 10 hours of battery life, but it’s way slow. Shouldn’t your notebook be as powerful as your handheld? Shouldn’t it run video without breaking a sweat, as the iPhone does?

      I recently put a new SSD in my system (yay!) and did a clean install of Windows 7, Visual Studio, etc. I found that when viewing my web app on localhost (using the Cassini web server built into VS), it was very slow. This was true across browsers.
Turns out it’s a DNS thing — the lookup for “localhost” was apparently going out to the DNS server, a waste. You can easily “short-circuit” this by modifying your hosts file.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I think it’s quite brilliant that Amazon has introduced spot pricing for servers. Great way to exploit unutilized CPUs and bring prices down. Nicholas Carr explains it in utility terms: At the end of the nineteenth century, Samuel Insull, president of the then-tiny Chicago Edison, started the electric utility revolution when he had the counterintuitive realization that to make more money his company had to cut its prices drastically, at least for those customers whose patterns of electricity use would help the utility maximize its capacity utilization.
