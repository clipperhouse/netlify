    <h2 class="post-title">Meetings are error states</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Paul Graham explores the difference between the maker’s schedule and the manager’s schedule. People that know me have heard me say that “meetings are the opposite of work”. Paul offers empathy: When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">A web developer friend of mine has been doing a lot of backend-integration-type work over the last year, and has therefore has not been developing web sites. He made a point of wading back in to the web this week, so as not to get too “rusty”, in his words.
He is working in ASP.net Web Forms — and the wading did not go well. He is struggling to do what he considers basic stuff like toggling between an edit form and a detail view....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Intel today announced faster and cheaper versions of their very impressive solid state hard drives (SSDs). I didn’t see any ship dates so I guess they are making their way into the sales channel now.
Since the new ones and the old ones share the X25-M model name, you’ll want to know which one you are getting.
To get the new ones, you’ll want to look for a “G2” at the end of the model name....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Known and unknown unknowns</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Jeff Atwood has an article revealing some things that I’ve learned about software and business in general: the dangerous belief in certainty.
Software is unique in that solved problems are easy to build on. Once a problem is considered “solved”, the solution can be exploited with little or no cost. (When’s the last time you worried about the TCP/IP stack when building a web app?)
Therefore, if a software developer is asked to create something new, she is in all likelihood solving a problem that has not been solved before....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">So, I’m a bit surprised that the upcoming Web version of Office isn’t based on Silverlight (Microsoft’s “rich internet application” framework). Instead, it appears that it will be browser-native, which is to say, written in Javascript.
From a Microsoft corporate perspective, this seems like it would be a perfect opportunity to promote Silverlight. As a relatively new platform, Silverlight’s biggest challenge is getting a widespread installed base. There will presumably be millions of people who wish to use the Web version of Office....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Walking to my client’s place this morning, I couldn’t help but wonder what-the-hell-is-that? as I approached the cafe:
Looking more closely…
So Google is doing physical, even 3-dimensional advertising here in SF. Nicely done.
But should we be concerned that Gavin Newsom — SF mayor and California gubernatorial candidate — is endorsing a product?...</p>

  <p class="post-summary">In one commercial, you’ll see Marlon Brando, Carols Santana, Marilyn Monroe and the Ramones, with a David Bowie tune in the background:
youtube [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQp8lzikSsU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0]
Usually you get derivatives “in the style” of those sorts of artists, on the cheap. I wonder what MasterCard paid for all that stuff....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">In this video, Chris Bryant of Microsoft makes an offhand comment that the components of the new Microsoft Office 2010 for Web are “some of the biggest Javascript applications ever built”.
The Javascript performance in Internet Explorer generally lags behind that of its competitors (Firefox, Safari, Chrome) — though the importance to the end user experience is debatable. IE has made strides, but the others have improved performance by orders of magnitude....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">There are rumors that Amazon is interested in buying Netflix. I like the idea, though it’s just one step toward the sort of subscription media consolidation that I outlined a while ago.
What Netflix offers Amazon is a highly-regarded service and a substantial audience. This is also known as a brand.
What Amazon offers Netflix is scale and a future. While Netflix is king of the heap in the DVD rental business right now, their future as a streaming company is anything but assured....</p>
