    <h2 class="post-title">Why can’t mobile apps have URLs?</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Dave Winer laments that mobile apps are not universally addressable via a locator like a URL.
Actually, they are, it’s just underexploited. For example, this little radio app allows me to deep-link specific radio stations as tiles on my (Win Phone 7) home screen.
Guess what? The tile has a URL, pointed to a specific place in the app. Now, I haven’t dug deeply enough to know about the security boundaries, but it seems to me it would be a small step to allow the app to register a namespace on the phone (app://appid) and expose endpoints to any other app....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">The Wall Street Journal restricts access to some stories — as when it will show you the first paragraph or two as a “Subscribe Content Preview”.
There’s an easy way to get around this if you want the whole story. (I am using the Chrome browser for this, should be similar in others.)
 Select the story headline, and right click to “Search Google for…”   Hopefully the desired story will be at the top of the search results, under News…   Click it!...</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">The binary web</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">It’s easy to see the web as sets of advances that come in waves. The first was its emergence as a consumer (and corporate) phenomenon, starting with Netscape and continuing through Internet Explorer 6 (which, we often forget, was the first “legitimate” browser for many businesses).
The second wave was Ajax and broadband. This combination allowed web sites to act less like pages and more like applications — responsive enough for things like email....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">In recent comments on Hacker News, I suggested, with some snark, that the definition of net neutrality is slippery and ad-hoc, and therefore exploitable. I was promptly voted down.
In this case, an ISP in Canada has introduced data caps — a reasonable if undesirable thing — and then went on to make their own video service exempt from counting against these caps.
Shady? Sure. Does it violate the suggested definitions of neutrality?...</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I haven’t tried Google&#43; (pronounced ploo, the French way), but I note that there hasn’t been the dismissive pile-on that greeted Buzz and Wave. My meta-analysis is that they might be on to something.
It’s been noted many times that Google has a social graph, even if they haven’t presented it as such. They know who your friends are via Gmail, and they know what you are interested in via Search and its many tentacles....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">It may be intemperate of me, but why do geeks respond in such a…Pavlovian way when given the opportunity to assume another person’s stupidity? The latest exhibit is Gizmodo, claiming that the New York Times has implemented their paywall poorly.
The paywall’s prima-facie purpose is to limit your ability to read articles past 20 a month, in the hope of converting you to a paid subscriber.
In truth, the NYT has very little ability to tell who you are, and therefore to count how many articles you’ve read....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Inversion of scarcity</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Every business, if it’s smart, should realize that the Internet has the ability to drop out its pricing floor, or more precisely, to eliminate the scarcity on which price depends. This is what is usually meant by the catchphrase “disruption.”
What often happens, subtly, is that the locus of scarcity is reversed — in the consumer’s favor.
Consider information businesses, like newspapers, classified ads, Bloomberg, and even employment agencies. It used to be that the information they supplied was scarce....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Implicit vs. explicit social graphs</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">There are two kinds of social graphs in the world, explicit and implicit. The explicit ones are the most rare and give their owners disproportionate market values.
The two I am thinking of are Facebook (private market value around $40B) and LinkedIn, with a public market cap of ~$6B. What makes their graphs explicit is that two individuals deliberately and mutually describe their connection with one another.
Implicit “soft” graphs include Twitter and Google (via Gmail)....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Design is information</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">It seems to me the companies with the greatest customer loyalty are those where design has a strong presence in the corporate culture. I don’t mean this in a touchy-feely way. I mean that customer loyalty is worth billions of dollars, and most companies see fit to leave that on the table.
Design is product. Fonts and colors are not design — they are decoration. Design is the hard work of understanding everything a customer might do, or want to do, how they will do it, and how they will be rewarded....</p>
