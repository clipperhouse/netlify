  I like seeing Google Fiber prompt incumbent dinosaurs into boosting speeds. It’s great.
But: it doesn’t matter much. I have 10x the bandwidth at work (gigabit) than I do at home. I barely notice it, however, for both technical and perceptual reasons.
In fact, my home internet recently improved 3x from ~30mbps to its current ~100mbps. Maybe videos achieve HD a little more quickly? Maybe?
Point being, I had decent bandwidth for my use cases, and the new bandwidth — which I am intellectually thrilled about — offers diminishing returns of actual utility.

  Jeff has a thoughtful post about open source, security and incentives. A few points stood out to me.
Liquidity First, the “all bugs are shallow” idea is a bit idealistic, as he points out. What comes to mind for me is Joel’s Hitting the High Notes. Tens of thousands of average developers will not pick up a bug that only experts would recognize, and adding another ten thousand won’t help.

  I got trolled by a facetious article on Go on April 1. But it did trigger a conversation about why Go doesn’t do certain things other languages do.
The answer, in several cases, is that Go chooses to make a clear distinction between expressions and statements. It chooses not to conflate them.
By way of definition, an expression is a thing that has (returns) a value. A statement is an imperative command to do something, but itself does not have a value.

  I’ve become adamant about making internal initiatives opt-in for the following reason: it brings more information to bear.
For example, at Stack, I started something called “Ask a Nerd”. The goal is to create a channel of communication between our sales people and our developers.
Now, I might easily have pushed for compelling all developers and sales people to participate. It stands to reason: if it’s a good idea, everyone should be part of it.

  We think of bugs as flaws in code. This is incorrect, or at best, banal.
Rather, the essential definition of a bug is that a programmer failed to predict what a piece of code would do.
See, smart programmers wrote the code. Other smart programmers looked at the code. It went into production, and did the wrong thing.
No programmer wanted it to do the wrong thing. They thought it would do the right thing.

  I was recently directed to a couple of papers on browser ad-blocking software (here and here). They are not so much alarmist as they are self-serving and hindered by status quo bias.
Ad blockers remind me of music piracy since the advent of Napster. The technical details are different, but the dynamic is the same — a consumer gets what they want at a lower price, through technical means.
Then, as now, few users thought of themselves as violating any rights.

  Here’s a nice little technique I came across in developing gen.
Say you have a text template, and that template is intended to output Go code. You’d like to pass a data structure into the template, and have the structure appear in the template as its own value literal.
There is a printf format string that does just this: %#v
Let’s say you have a template like: p := {{.}}

  As recruiter pitches show up in my inbox, it’s clear there’s a lot of “fake it til you make it” when it comes to tech terminology.
One arrived today, telling me that “dependency injection” is a hot technology these days, and that their client was hiring people with that skill.
For a short moment, I was impressed that such specificity was included in a cold email — a hint of credibility.

  Fred Wilson makes the argument (here and here) that net neutrality is a conservative idea. That’s correct, and that’s the problem.
My definition of “conservative” is “seeking to preserve accreted value”. It fights change, because change is considered dangerous. It is (perhaps rational) risk-aversion and loss-aversion.
For example, environmental protection is conservative. Preferring traditional marriage is conservative.
(You’ll note that people who support those respective ideas are not typically found within the same political tribe, which is my semantic point.

  A quick list of the things I use to improve my web experience:
HTTPS Everywhere – Does its best to detect whether a site offers HTTPS, and switches to that if so.
DNSCrypt – DNS traffic can be encrypted, too.
Block third-party cookies – In Chrome it’s a checkbox at chrome://settings/content. In Safari, it’s the default. Fluid is a nice Safari wrapper, btw.
AdBlock Plus – Ad blocker that’s open source.
