    <h2 class="post-title">Wizards in ASP.Net MVC: being selective with ModelState</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">So, there are many ways to skin the cat we called form validation. With a wizard-style application, it requires some nuance.
With ASP.Net MVC, a traditional way to do validation is to use ModelState. ModelState is a property on your controller where you can collect errors relating to your Model. For example, if a LastName property is required, you would do something like this:
if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(lastName))
ModelState.AddModelError(“lastName”, “A last name is required....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I am playing with the Microsoft Ajax Minifier, which removes whitespace from your Javascripts for quicker download. Stephen Walther has a nice how-to.
In my case, I am using the MSBuild task, which will minimize your Javascripts on build. Works great on my machine. But here’s the gotcha: if you have a build server that does not have the Minifier installed, your build will fail.
What to do? In my case, I updated Stephen’s MSBuild code with a Condition such that the task will only run under the Debug configuration....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Since moving from Cali to NY, I’ve come to miss my favorite radio station, KDFC. They rule, especially Hoyt Smith on my clock radio in the morning.
So I stream it via iTunes on the PC. Sounds great even if I can’t wake up to it.
But the iPhone doesn’t do Internet radio easily. It has the capability of streaming audio, but only through a roundabout process or some unintuitive app....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">WTF Intel?</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">One would think, after announcing the product in July, that Intel might be shipping its next-gen solid state hard drives. One would be wrong.
I think one of the biggest uses of these drives will be to resuscitate old machines that would otherwise be tossed. A four-year-old CPU is still faster than what most people need, but if you swap out the slowest part of the machine (the disk), you might find you have a perfectly good netbook....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">The iPhone calendar has a separate time zone from the phone</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">After my recent move to NYC, I discovered that my Google Calendar was 3 hours off from my iPhone calendar. No worries, just go into the iPhone Settings — General — Date &amp; Time and make sure the phone understands the time zone. Huh, well, it’s set automatically, over the air.
There is a setting in Google Calendar for time zone. Changed that. No joy.
Finally, I looked deep into the iPhone’s Mail, Contacts and Calendar settings — and way at the bottom of that screen, you set the time zone for the calendar....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">keyCode vs charCode vs Firefox</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I am working on a filtered HTML field. The idea is to only allow alphanumeric characters to be typed, and have all other keystrokes ignored.
I am using the keypress event in jQuery to capture the keystrokes — my function returns true for valid characters (which simply passes the event to the field) and false for everything else (which kills the event before it can “reach” the field).
The behavior was fine in IE and Chrome, but not in Firefox....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">OK, so a friend is raving about his Droid phone, and it sounds quite cool. The Palm Pre has some good ideas too. Hopefully a little competition will keep Apple from being Apple — “we know what’s best for you” — too often.
So, a few things that would dramatically improve the email experience on the iPhone, for this humble user anyway.

    <h2 class="post-title">The emergence of Big Data (2.0)</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I’ve written previously on the idea that data, not algorithms, will be a main differentiator for web companies moving forward. What does this mean?
In short, it’s not hard to hire very smart people to write algorithms. One or two PhD’s can produce a lot of great logic. But algorithms need data — big data — to be useful, and that’s considerably harder to amass. Only a small number of firms will have it, and it will represent a barrier to entry that nimble startups can’t climb....</p>
