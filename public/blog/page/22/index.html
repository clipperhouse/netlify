  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Google recently acquired On2, a company that creates video codecs, most notably for Flash (which is used on the most popular video sites). Dan Rayburn runs down and debunks a number of theories as to what Google has in mind. Rightly, he says that none are obviously correct.
(Side note, I‚Äôve used On2‚Äôs Flix products for some time.)
I don‚Äôt think Google has an immediate tactical goal with the acquisition. They are delivering video just fine without owning the technology....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Random numbers web service</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Generating numbers that are truly random is quite difficult. Every random number needs to be based on some starting place‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe time of day in milliseconds, perhaps. As such it‚Äôs actually a predictable number; it‚Äôs deterministic, even if a regular human won‚Äôt realistically guess it.
For most of what we do, we create a pseudo-random number‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääone that is random enough for our purposes. Yet I‚Äôve experienced situations where the ‚Äúpseudo‚Äù part becomes very apparent....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">So, in the Apple-Google-AT&amp;T kerfuffle over Google Voice being rejected from the iPhone, I haven‚Äôt heard many reasons I consider viable. This one is: I‚Äôve been asking myself exactly why Apple or AT&amp;T would stir up the hornet‚Äôs nest to deny the technology and risk the ire of both the government and one of their most valuable partners, and also why each company‚Äôs stance is full of contradictory actions.After a little reflection, the answer became resoundingly clear: Apple is building a similar service to add to MobileMe....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">A very interesting study of the idea of ‚Äúgrit‚Äù. It attempts to quantify personal characteristics than lead to success via perseverance.
I often wonder if I have it. I am willing to take risks which depend on my intelligence‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI quit my job to start a startup. But I really fear that I‚Äôve gotten soft.
I get bored easily; this is the opposite of grit. So perhaps those who have ‚Äúgrit‚Äù are the ones who have found a way to feel rewarded even when the work is boring....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">In the current FCC-involved kerfuffle over why Apple or AT&amp;T blocked Google Voice on the iPhone, I see opportunity.
I am not convinced that AT&amp;T is the reason for blocking the app. It certainly could be, but from a technical perspective, a Google Voice call is the same as an AT&amp;T call. It doesn‚Äôt strain their network.
The only person to touch on a plausible explanation is Michael Arrington who notes that number portability is the real bugaboo from AT&amp;T‚Äôs perspective....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I recently experienced an issue using the Amazon Product Advertising API (formerly the Amazon Associates Web Service). I was getting a ‚Äú403 Forbidden‚Äù error for what seemed like a normal request.
I am using the sample C# code provided here, along with the Amazon.ECS library (which apparently is no longer supported by Amazon).
I was doing an ItemSearchRequest, with a search term of ‚Äúblack swan‚Äù.
I tracked the error down to the encoding of the search terms....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Dong Ngo over at CNET has a review of the experience of installing the final Windows 7 on a new (unibody) MacBook Pro.
The install works. However, the battery life is awful: What‚Äôs missing has been a known issue with Mac laptop running Boot Camp: the battery life. According to Apple, the MacBook Pro offers about eight hours of battery life (in my experience it‚Äôs more like about five hours, which is still very impressive)....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">The thing that computers are good at is brainless repetition. They are perfect when you‚Äôve figured out a logical problem and need to exploit it over and over.
In programming, we achieve this with encapsulation and abstraction. If we have 100 gifts to wrap, we could write:
 ChooseWrappingPaper() Go to Walgreens Make purchase CutWrappingPaper() Measure box Take out scissors Snip snip FitToGift() If fuzzy sweater, then‚Ä¶ If bottle of wine, then‚Ä¶ FastenWithTape()  If we write that code 100 times, it is time-consuming, error-prone and requires no use of our noggins....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I‚Äôve had idle chats with techie friends wondering whether search engines such as Google simply index the raw HTML of your web page, or do they actually parse and ‚Äúdisplay‚Äù it as a true browser would.
I‚Äôve generally believed they must be doing the latter. These days, a lot of a page‚Äôs content may be generated by Javascript and therefore would not appear in the raw HTML as served by the web server....</p>
