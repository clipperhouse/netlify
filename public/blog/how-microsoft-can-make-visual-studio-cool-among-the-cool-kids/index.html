<p>I am quite partial to ASP.net MVC and C#. I’ve played with other platforms, esp Ruby, which have appeal as well.</p>

<p>While many aspects of the platform are, imho, technologically ahead of its competition (LINQ, Intellisense and Razor), I can’t shake the feeling that MS still appeals primarily to those with an enterprise background. Which is to say, the cool kids are choosing Rails and doing their editing on a Mac.</p>

<p>It needn’t be this way. Microsoft can do a small handful of things to make Visual Studio relevant to these trends, by reducing the unresolved pain points one experiences across all platforms. My ideas:</p>

<h4 id="best-of-breed-ide-for-dynamic-frameworks-especially-ruby-on-rails">Best-of-breed IDE for dynamic frameworks, especially Ruby on Rails.</h4>

<p>I haven’t seen anyone crack the nut of code completion for methods and properties that are <em>likely to exist at runtime</em>. Rails’ conventions are pretty clear, and it seems to me that Intellisense should be able to use this information to offer hints and save keystrokes.</p>

<p>At the very least, VS should do basic syntax coloring for Ruby and Python out of box, with Intellisense for core keywords — just as they did with jQuery.</p>

<h4 id="workflow-and-gui-support-for-the-major-source-control-systems-git-svn-and-mercurial">Workflow and GUI support for the major source control systems: Git, SVN and Mercurial.</h4>

<p>Command lines suck. There, I said it. I consider them a failure of imagination. Which is to say, I think of workflows visually, and I wish the tools were with me.</p>

<p>Nobody has done a great job with source control GUIs yet. The Tortoise-* and Visual-* folks have done some nice things, but they are not nearly where they could be. They are Windows 3.1, design-wise.</p>

<p>Imagine a clear visual picture of your source <strong>built into the IDE and Windows Explorer</strong>. Imagine your “git status” files staged in real time in a sidebar. Imagine a system that pings the main repo and gives you a hint of what others have done lately.</p>

<p>The simple tasks of add/commit/push/pull should be two clicks, max. No one is doing this yet, I see a huge opportunity for the one who gets it right.</p>

<p><em>PS: I recognize that Microsoft can’t <em>ship</em> any of these source control systems. But they can obviously detect a .git folder.</em></p>

<p><em>PPS: I know that source control workflows often require command-line precision. But the 80% case should be achievable in a GUI.</em></p>
