<p>Jeff has a <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/given-enough-money-all-bugs-are-shallow/">thoughtful post</a> about open source, security and incentives. A few points stood out to me.</p>

<h4 id="liquidity">Liquidity</h4>

<p>First, the “all bugs are shallow” idea is a bit idealistic, as he points out. What comes to mind for me is Joel’s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html">Hitting the High Notes</a>. Tens of thousands of average developers will not pick up a bug that only experts would recognize, and adding another ten thousand won’t help.</p>

<p>If we have a “chunky”, discrete Gaussian distribution of talent reviewing the code, the area under of the far right-hand tail may be indistinguishable from zero.</p>

<p>Few markets are liquid enough for distributions to be smooth, which allows <em>some</em> area under the right tail.</p>

<p>For example, casinos doing millions of bets with known probabilities have smooth, measurable, non-zero tails; they are liquid enough to predict that <em>someone</em> will win a million dollars.</p>

<p>An open source project with an audience <em>not</em> in the millions, less so. At some point moving right, the graph will <strong>discretely drop to zero</strong>. That zero represents “the number of people smart enough to identify difficult bugs”.</p>

<h4 id="incentives">Incentives</h4>

<p>Second, we consider incentives. Jeff explores the idea that paying for bugs may both be necessary and risky.</p>

<p>He sees moral hazard: perhaps there is an incentive to hoard important information for a payoff. Maybe only the wealthiest organizations can afford to pay for vulnerabilities, as their value is bid up.</p>

<p>But let’s consider the audience. A person that discovers a bug in an important piece of software is someone with an unusually strong interest in that software. They are likely a user, and therefore are more likely interested in having better software, for their own interests.</p>

<p>The alternative to imagine mercenaries that dive into unfamiliar software in the hope of a payoff. Not impossible! But unlikely.</p>

<p>Which is an essential quality of open source that confuses those new to it — that volunteers work not only on goodwill, but on self-interest.</p>

<p>I’ll stretch the analogy. The person next to you on the plane might be a terrorist. Not impossible!</p>

<p>But it’s more likely that, if they showed up where you showed up, they simply want the same things you do.</p>

<h4 id="cheaper">Cheaper</h4>

<p>What if security becomes too cheap to meter? Which is to say, what happens if improving software quality requires a lot fewer humans?</p>

<p>In that case, the economics and incentives questions become a lot less salient.</p>

<p>It’s possible — likely, to my mind — that safer software will not come mainly from greater resources, but better tools.</p>

<p>The two that come to mind are formal methods and safer languages. (These are actually two sides of the same coin.)</p>

<p>To the extent that we can formally articulate a definition for “safety”, we can prove a program’s characteristics with static analysis. Describing code paths in terms of provable propositions allows us to know where logical guarantees exist, and where they don’t.</p>

<p>We talk less about talent and trust, and more about the existence, or non-existence, of guarantees.</p>

<p>And heck, even informally: languages like Rust and Go prevent classes of human errors that C cannot. Using such languages, we prevent <em>the humans</em> from making certain classes of mistakes.</p>

<p>Both of the above strike me a relatively cheap and automatable, and therefore more likely a source of progress than foundations and funding.</p>
