  <p>I know I am getting repetitive but I have to ask again — why is Intel having so much trouble shipping its second-generation solid-state drives (the X25-M G2)?</p>

<p>A look around the web reveals that supplies are extremely constrained or non-existent. Amazon shows <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B002IJA1EG/ref=ord_cart_shr?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;v=glance">not in stock</a>. NewEgg is <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820167016&amp;amp;cm_re=x25-m-_-20-167-016-_-Product">sold out</a>. Other smaller sellers at Amazon are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B002IJA1EG/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;condition=new">showing inventory</a>, but at prices well above MSRP — this indicates that these sellers are probably grasping at 1 or 2 units at a time.</p>

<p>It’s Xmas, yo, and Win7 is burnin’ up the charts. Doesn’t Intel want a piece?</p>

<p>Intel usually executes, no? I’ve been wanting to buy one of these for <a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20090721comp.htm?cid=rss-90004-c1-236380">months</a>, and I expect there are a few hundred thousand like me. I keep hoping to find their SSDs as options at Lenovo, Dell or Apple. Intel is leaving money on the table.</p>

<p>Anyone have a inside tip? Is it <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=intel+x25-m+defects">quality control</a>? Raw materials?</p>
