  <p>Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp. — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule">Greenspun</a></p>

<p>I am reminded of this quote when I see a common pattern in data stores, especially RDBMS. It’s a key-value pattern, along the lines of:
<code>Columns: IDType | ID | Value</code></p>

<p>…combined with application code which branches on the IDType column. The Value (and heck, the identifier) are interpreted differently based on the type.</p>

<p>This is a fine pattern depending on one’s goals. But it’s important to understand the choice one is making here: <strong>we’ve created a dynamic type system</strong>. Those if’s and switch’s are type resolution, happening at runtime.</p>

<p>With a RDBMS, a table typically maps to a single type, say “Person”. One can completely express the shape of that entity in code, requiring no conditionals at runtime. Values flow into known slots.</p>

<p>Using the pattern at top, by contrast, one might create a “Documents” table. IDType might be “PDF” or “Section” or whatever; the Value may be a complex payload or a reference to another entity.</p>

<p>And it can work great. As a key-value store, the store is “dumb”: meaning happens in code. This can give you great performance and a lot of presentation choices at runtime.</p>

<p>But one gives up a large class of static (compile-time) type guarantees; one inevitably will do “type” checks at runtime, to combat newly-possible <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=make%20illegal%20states%20unrepresentable">illegal states</a>.</p>

<p>Too often, such code looks like an <em>ad hoc, informally-specified, slow</em> type system.</p>

<p>The upshot is, it’s a trade-off between safety and flexibility, exactly as with static and dynamic type systems. If one chooses the latter, plan on accounting for legal and illegal states in application code — and be clear about guarantees the system will and won’t offer.</p>
