<div class="post-content"><p>Tim Lee offers <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2012/05/27/two-views-of-innovation/">two views</a> of the economic case for innovation. I am certainly more Hayekian — I think expertise and information is inherently dispersed and the Hayekian view is more granular, if you will. It’s more likely to discover and serve niches and inefficiencies.</p>

<p>I think Tim hits the nail on the head that:
Building an iPad didn’t just require millions of dollars, it required that those millions be spent by the <em>right company.</em> And the only way to figure out which company is the right one is to let a bunch of them try and fail.</p>

<p>I’ll go further. The Hayekian view is still not “rational” in an economic sense. Creating a startup, or a radically new product, is usually a recipe for economic failure.</p>

<p>What the Hayekian view allows, and why I love it, is that it makes room for “madness”. It allows economic irrationality on a granular scale.</p>

<p><strong>Startups are optimized for the personal ambitions of their founders, not for economic success.</strong> The creation of Google, Apple and others were not rational or irrational, per se — they were driven by the desires of their founders. Billions of dollars later, we craft their histories into a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=narrative+fallacy">narrative</a> that sounds like economics.</p>

<p>The process of going from nothing to something, however, is inherently irrational — or more precisely, impossible to reason about statistically. Peter Thiel calls this the <a href="http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/20400301508/cs183class1">0 to 1</a> problem. To embark on it is to leave the world of economic modeling.</p>

<p>The Hayekian view doesn’t require large, supposedly-rational, profit-maximizing institutions for progress. Rather, progress requires madness, that is, the freedom to pursue choices whose rationality can’t be measured.</p>
