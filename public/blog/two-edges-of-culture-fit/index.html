<div class="post-content"><p>Here’s a <a href="http://qz.com/225782/the-next-thing-silicon-valley-needs-to-disrupt-big-time-its-own-culture/">smart and funny bit</a> about culture fit. I think it’s brutal and by and large true. [1]</p>

<p>When I first heard the term “culture fit”, I thought intuitively, <em>yes</em>. Great way to build a company. Companies are cultures and we should aim to build them.</p>

<p>Then, not long after, I thought, <em>wait</em>. “Culture fit” among highly-educated-20-something-males-on-the-spectrum might not actually make for a great culture, if it’s going to be of any size.</p>

<p>That last bit is key: “culture fit” is probably unavoidable in early days, but rapidly transitions to creepy when your company starts growing.</p>

<p>When you start from scratch, you choose partners. To partner up, by definition, means you probably share a vision. Otherwise, why would you be partners?</p>

<p>In all likelihood, sharing a vision means sharing priors. So your early team will not be diverse. It will likely be a tight group of people whose cultures, um, fit.</p>

<p>(It doesn’t <em>have</em> to be this way. But odds are it will.)</p>

<p>Now, if your company’s goal are to be a tight, focused lifestyle business, great. That’s a good way to go. You don’t need much diversity.</p>

<p>However, if you are funded, your goals are probably a big audience and a big exit. Your ability to reach new and diverse audiences requires diversity in your company. I don’t just mean skin color and gender. I mean, people of varying experiences who see opportunities that you don’t.</p>

<p>You need type-A glad-handing salespeople. You need <a href="http://medriscoll.com/post/9117396231/the-guild-of-silicon-valley">neckbeard</a> sysadmins. You need touchy-feely designers. You need nagging accountants. They will grow the business. And you won’t get them if they need to be like you.</p>

<p>(If you achieve the above, you’ll get the skin-tone-and-gender diversity for free, btw.)</p>

<p>So, start with culture fit. Then know when to lay off.</p>
