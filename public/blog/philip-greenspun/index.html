<div class="post-content"><p>…is someone I hadn’t heard of until I read this very amusing post: <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2009/05/18/ruby-on-rails-and-the-importance-of-being-stupid/">Ruby on Rails and the importance of being stupid</a>. The comments are every bit as interesting as the article.</p>

<p>I like his <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/politics/economic-recovery">economic thinking</a> too, with obligatory reference to the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060936428?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=clipperhouse-20&amp;amp;link_code=as3&amp;amp;camp=211189&amp;amp;creative=373489&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0060936428">The Forgotten Man</a>, which I am now “reading” (ie, glancing at, half-finished, on my desk).</p>

<p>I was a physics major, not a computer science guy. Turns out physics is great training for the problem-solving that programmers do. I was surprised by what Philip <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2007/08/23/improving-undergraduate-computer-science-education/">had to say about computer science</a>, not least that most CS graduates are not good programmers and that MIT apparently doesn’t offer a course on databases?</p>

<p>Having not taken CS, I’ve wondered what they teach. Is it low-level how-does-RAM-work type stuff? Because most of the practicable skills I see in programmers come from experience, even if they have the degree. Seems to me a person with a technical mind, motivation, and a grounding in math could become a very good programmer in about two focused years.</p>

<p>To be a great programmer, s/he would also have to be a <a href="/blog/post/Nulls-and-knowledge.aspx">linguist</a>. :)</p>
