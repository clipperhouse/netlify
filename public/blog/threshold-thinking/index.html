So, being charitable, 90% of ads that we put on our sites are of no economic value, which is to say, of no value to the user.">

<div class="post-content"><p>I consider our industry’s current approach to ads to be wildly inefficient. Very “good” click-through rates are in the single-digit percentages, and more likely one or two orders of magnitude below that.</p>

<p>Let’s assume for the sake of argument that some brand advertising is valuable, which is to say that the impression serves a purpose even if the user doesn’t click.</p>

<p>So, being charitable, 90% of ads that we put on our sites are of no economic value, which is to say, of no value to the user.</p>

<p>This makes them a degradation of our product. We go to great lengths to get the design just-so, and then we mar it with an element that serves the user not at all.</p>

<p>I don’t say this because I am against ads; I am against ads for which there is no evidence of value.</p>

<p>I think of this in economic terms. Ads are negative consumer surplus in 90% of cases. They make our published product a worse value. Over time, customers should be expected to migrate to products that provide better value.</p>

<p>I don’t expect this to simply be solved by better targeting which nudges up click-through rates. There needs to be an order-of-magnitude change.</p>

<p>I’d like to see the first publisher or ad network that <strong>only chooses to serve ads for which it has evidence of economic value</strong>; in the absence of such evidence, an ad is not shown at all.</p>

<p>Our current method of ad delivery is spray-and-pray. If we are <em>very</em> good at targeting, 10% of the ads have value. What if we had higher standards than that?</p>
