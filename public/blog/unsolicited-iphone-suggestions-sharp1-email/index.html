  <p>OK, so a friend is raving about his Droid phone, and it sounds quite cool. The Palm Pre has some good ideas too. Hopefully a little competition will keep Apple from being Apple — “we know what’s best for you” — too often.</p>

<p>So, a few things that would dramatically improve the email experience on the iPhone, for this humble user anyway.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Unified email view:</strong> Allow me to see all my email messages, from multiple accounts, in one list. The Blackberry does this, and they combine SMS into the same view while they’re at it.</li>
<li><strong>Status-at-a-glance:</strong> How many <em>new</em> email messages do you have? There is no way of knowing on the iPhone. I can see the count of <em>unread</em> ones, but then I’d have to remember what that number was an hour ago to know if anything’s new. And please, <a href="/blog/post/A-simple-way-that-Apple-can-improve-iPhone-battery-life-and-user-experience.aspx">why must I log in</a> to find this out?</li>
<li><strong>Email folder bookmarks:</strong> I haven’t seen anyone suggest this yet. Allow me to place a bookmark directly into a specific mail folder or account, on my home screen. Update that icon with a badge indicating new/unread in that folder. This will dovetail very well with the filters I have set up in Gmail.</li>
<li><strong>Unified contacts:</strong> The Palm Pre <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZboVu8Xa_0">does</a> this: it brings in pictures and other info from your Facebook, LinkedIn, etc and matches them with your contacts. A little <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a> integration might be clever, too.</li>
</ul>
