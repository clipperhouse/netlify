<p>While the name connotes a ‘disorder’, certain obsessive behaviors make for very effective programmers. Remember, code that is 99% right is wrong. Crashingly, money-losingly wrong. OCD is made for this profession.</p>

<p>Its strength, however, is also its weakness: it monopolizes our attention. Our ability to dive deep, to focus, to simply <em>not let things go</em>, makes for amazing code and terrible time management.</p>

<p>To me, this makes programmers something you don’t hear often: <em>visceral</em>. We think we do big-brain work; perhaps we do. But our decision of what to prioritize in this moment, and for the next several moments, is often pure <em>id</em>.</p>

<p>Herein lies the confusion: obsession as a proxy for high standards. The difference is that high standards are defined by what we deliver to others; OCD is not.</p>

<p>OCD is entirely about the self. It is an urge to be assuaged.</p>

<p>‘High standards’ (for lack of a better expression) are closer to ethics, or <em>ego</em>. They describe the desire to do the right thing <em>for others</em>, regardless of reward. It is outward where OCD is inward.</p>

<p>The distinction is not binary, to be sure. OCD can be a great tool to be deployed in the service of high standards.</p>

<p>Think of it this way: you’re swinging a hammer. Are you building a bench, or pounding a nail?</p>
