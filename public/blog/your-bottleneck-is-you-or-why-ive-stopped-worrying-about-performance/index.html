<p>Like Jeff Atwood, I consider end-user <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/a-few-speed-improvements/">performance to be a feature</a>. Pages should <em>snap</em>. It sends a very positive signal to customers, IMHO. And the site should snap with 10 or 10,000 users.</p>

<p>That said, as a developer I am learning to worry less about the little things when it comes to performance.</p>

<p>For example, I went to a SQL Server talk where they worried about how many disk spindles to split the load across. And I read others worrying about whether String or StringBuilder will <a href="http://blog.briandicroce.com/2008/02/04/stringbuilder-vs-string-performance-in-net/">concatenate faster</a>, and under what circumstances.</p>

<p>And that’s all well-and-good.</p>

<p>But I’ve found that even on relatively low-end hardware, reasonable code is plenty fast. And by reasonable, I mean code that avoids the most obvious pitfalls like the <a href="http://www.pbell.com/index.cfm/2006/9/17/Understanding-the-n1-query-problem">n+1 problem</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I prefer to focus on the logic. That is, I treat languages more declaratively as time goes on. I spend more time focusing on <em>what</em> and less time worrying about the <em>how</em> that happens under the covers.</p>

<p>We come far enough that hardware costs are trivial for all but the <a href="/blog/post/Scale-means-reversing-your-thinking-on-the-database.aspx">top 1% of sites</a>. And modern compilers do a great job of turning high-level languages into fast machine code.</p>

<p><strong>In all likelihood, your bottleneck is not your tools. Your bottleneck is your time.</strong></p>

<p>So take advantage of modern platforms, reclaim your time, and focus on your customers.</p>
