Meanwhile, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer — the target of repeated anti-trust charges by the EU — <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/03/firefox-3-marketshare-exceeds-internet-explorer-7-in-europe.ars">hovers under 50%</a> in Europe.</p>

<p>By <a href="/blog/post/Can-Google-Chrome-OS-get-traction.aspx">creating an operating system</a>, it seems that Google is doing what monopolists are prohibited from doing: extending its dominance from one market to another. (Of course, Google’s new OS doesn’t exist yet and won’t have substantial market share for several years.)</p>

<p>I wonder if Google’s entry into the new market will concern the EU regulators…?</p>
