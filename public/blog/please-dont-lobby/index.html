He comes to the conclusion that we need to lobby more.</p>

<p>I disagree. Throwing money down the lobby hole starts a vicious circle. We pay to play, and Congress finds new ways to milk the cow — or to create problems that justify their existence. As Clay Shirky <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky#The_Shirky_Principle">put it</a>:
Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.</p>

<p>Asking permission of Congress, or seeking their assistance, becomes the norm. Just look at the telecom business.</p>

<p>Don’t we, as an industry, do the “disrupt” thing? Don’t we disintermediate? Except when it’s Congress, and we are blindsided — in which case we embrace the status quo, with vigor?</p>

<p>A month ago, I suggested:</p>

<p><img src="http://clipperhouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/lobbying1.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Becoming one of many moneyed interests diminishes us, and makes the world a worse place. Let’s disintermediate.</p>

<p>This means dropping out the pricing floor. What Skype did for phone calls, what Google did for information retrieval, and what Amazon is doing with publishing.</p>

<p>They did this by looking at the interest of the consumer (read: voter), first and foremost — existing institutions’ concerns were considerably lower on the list.</p>

<p>And so it must be with democracy. The existing system of buying favor is vastly overpriced. Let’s deflate it.</p>

<p>How? Yeah, I don’t know yet. But it’s an economic problem. The future is in doing what Congress does for an order of magnitude cheaper.</p>

<p>Their influence and their pricing power are one in the same.</p>
