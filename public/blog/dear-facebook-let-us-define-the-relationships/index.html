<div class="post-content"><p>We’ve begun implementing some of Facebook’s Open Graph on <a href="http://alikewise.com/">Alikewise</a>, my dating startup. By <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2010/04/24/FacebooksOpenGraphProtocolFromAWebDevelopersPerspective.aspx">Dare Obasanjo’s definition</a>, books are our main “social object”.</p>

<p>(The site is based around the idea that a person will associate themselves with any number of books, with the hope that this will inspire notice by other singles.)</p>

<p>Indeed, the Open Graph protocol is a step toward a more semantic web by allowing us to put <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph#types">agreed-upon metadata</a> into our pages. What it doesn’t do is allow us to <strong>define relationships</strong> among the metadata. Facebook reserves this right for itself.</p>

<p>For example, books obviously have authors. There is no way to define this relationship, as far as I can tell. We can indicate that a page is about a book <em>or</em> about an author, but not both. Ditto actors and movies, or politicians and their voting history.</p>

<p>In other words, one page = one freestanding social object. We need more.</p>

<p>On my site, I’d like to associate a person with any number of books, in a way that is meaningful outside our site. (A person might choose to identify themselves via Facebook, Twitter or any OpenID, for example.)</p>

<p>Then, any third-party site could aggregate a profile of a person based on Alikewise’s information and others. One might Google “people who like <a href="http://alikewise.com/Books/Details/180">Catch-22</a>” and get more meaningful results.</p>

<p>The Open Graph is helpful in that it pushes a semantic web forward, using Facebook’s market power. And via its Like button, Facebook can indeed relate people to social objects. I would like this ability extended beyond Facebook’s firewall.</p>
