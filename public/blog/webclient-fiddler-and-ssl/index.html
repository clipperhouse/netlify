<div class="post-content"><p>I am developing a credit card authorization library which uses the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient.aspx">WebClient</a> class. In addition, I am using the excellent <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com">Fiddler</a> to watch the requests and responses.</p>

<p>As you might expect, the credit card web service is HTTPS. Fiddler is acting as a proxy server on my dev machine.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, WebClient throws an exception: “The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish secure channel for SSL/TLS”. As well it should — the SSL certificate in this case is not the one supplied by credit card authorizer. Fiddler is intercepting the request and issuing its own dummy certificate, as it must.</p>

<p>So we’ve got a man-in-the-middle, and WebClient doesn’t like it. What to do?</p>

<p>Turns out there is a way of telling System.Net to allow invalid certificates to pass. Here’s the code.</p>

<p>[code:c#]using System.Net;<br />
using System.Net.Security;<br />
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;<br />
using System.Web;</p>

<p>public static class Network<br />
{<br />
 public static void AllowInvalidCertificate()<br />
 {<br />
 if (HttpContext.Current.Request.Url.Host == “localhost”)<br />
 {<br />
 ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback += new RemoteCertificateValidationCallback(allowCert);<br />
 }<br />
 }</p>

<p>private static bool allowCert(object sender, X509Certificate cert, X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors error)<br />
 {<br />
 return true;<br />
 }<br />
}<br />
[/code]</p>

<p>I implemented it as a static class so when I need it in my code I just call Network.AllowInvalidCertificate(). Now my WebClient requests work without throwing an Exception, and Fiddler is able to show me those requests so I can debug.</p>

<p>Do I need to tell you that this is a security risk, so be careful? We’re disabling one of the fundamental purposes of SSL.</p>

<p>In my case, you’ll notice I check for localhost first, to reduce the risk that this gets called on a production site. You’ll want to put your own precautions in there as well.</p>
