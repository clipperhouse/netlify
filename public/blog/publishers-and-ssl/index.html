    <main class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Here’s a good article about why news sites on the web are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/11/news-sites-could-protect-your-privacy-with-encryption-heres-why-they-probably-wont/">slow to embrace SSL</a>. The short answer is, the advertising services they use are not prepared to support it.</p>

<p>This seems like an opportunity for publishers. How about this: make SSL available now, and turn off ads until the technical issues are settled. That’s right.</p>

<p>Firstly, it sends a pro-consumer message: “we’ve upgraded our site at no charge to you”.</p>

<p>Second, it offers the publisher a bit of market segmentation: users who seek out the SSL site are probably well-informed and relatively elite. Publishers can pitch them a subscription or, ding ding, better-targeted ads.</p>

<p>Third, the click-through rate on ads is less than 1%. Most ad impressions are wasted, and thus degrade the sites on which they appear. Maybe fewer ads will demonstrate what a better product looks like.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, there is a clear competitive benefit to be offered to customers, which requires a short-term loss against a long-term gain for the product and for the industry. Seems like an opportunity.</p>
