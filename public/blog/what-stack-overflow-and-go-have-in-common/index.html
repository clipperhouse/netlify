  <p>I’ve been working at Stack for over three years now, and over the last six months or so I’ve been doing <a href="http://clipperhouse.github.io/gen/">playing with</a> a programming language called Go. Both are highly regarded and, for many, controversial, and I’ve realized what they have in common.</p>

<p>Stack Overflow and Go are both <strong>optimized for artifacts</strong>. Which is to say, their goal is to create good outcomes that last a long time. Note that this is not the same as optimizing for the pleasure of their users.</p>

<p>Stack users are sometimes <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=stackoverflow%20useful%20closed&amp;amp;src=typd">frustrated</a> the strictness of our policies, especially regarding the relevance and objectivity of questions. Go users often gripe about the need to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/5V2XPWksny8">constantly</a> be handling errors at their source — bubbling and catching exceptions is just not a thing.</p>

<p>What both of these <em>design choices</em> have in common is that they help to ensure that what comes out the other side is actually of value.</p>

<p>And make no mistake, they are design choices. They are not technical shortcomings or oversights.</p>

<p>Now, these choices need to be balanced against the pleasure of the authors. If Go were hard to write, or Stack capriciously rejected good questions, neither would be a success.</p>

<p>What both of them demand is, do your homework. Stack questioner: take the time to research your question and express it clearly. Go programmer: that file system call can fail, and your code needs to account for that.</p>

<p>It’s a <a href="http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/3242/20130730/human-body-distinguishes-between-hedonic-eudaimonic-happiness-molecular-level.htm">trade-off</a> between the hedonic happiness of authors in exchange for a longer-term eudaimonia of end users.</p>
