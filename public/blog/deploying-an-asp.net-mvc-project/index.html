<p>I am doing my builds on a server with CruiseControl.Net. Google led me to things like <a href="http://blogs.iis.net/msdeploy/">msdeploy</a>, which I am sure is great, but really I shouldn’t need another tool.</p>

<p>I need two steps implemented as simply as possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build it</li>
<li>Move the built project to directory that IIS points to — but only the <em>required</em> files</li>
</ul>

<p>The build step is straightforward and familiar to those who use CC: the <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/MsBuild+Task">MsBuild Task</a>. It builds in-place.</p>

<p>For the deployment, why complicate it? I just use robocopy to move the files from the built source, while being selective. Thus:</p>

<p>robocopy “C:\MyStuff\Source\Alikewise.Web” “C:\MyStuff\Dev” *.dll *.aspx *.ascx *.asax *.master *.ico *.gif *.png *.jpg *.js *.css *.config /S /PURGE /XF *.pdb *.cs *.csproj *.t4 *.tt /XD .svn obj</p>

<p>It looks long but that’s only because I am being very specific about what files to copy. A web project needs:</p>

<ul>
<li>dll’s</li>
<li>views (aspx, ascx, asax and master files)</li>
<li>images (png, gif, jpg, ico)</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Config files</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s enough, but for good measure I make sure to exclude:</p>

<ul>
<li>C# source</li>
<li>Debug files</li>
<li>Project files</li>
</ul>

<p>And it works! Have a better suggestion? Lemme know.</p>
