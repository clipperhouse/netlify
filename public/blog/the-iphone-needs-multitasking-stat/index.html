<div class="post-content"><p>Joshua Topolsky offers a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/07/10/editorial-taking-the-iphone-3gs-off-the-job-market/">very funny and insightful take</a> on the iPhone’s very fundamental flaw: it is designed for doing one thing at a time.
[…] my work requires that I use a bunch of web tools, look at lots of news sites, and have a feed reader open… basically, things that would require some level of multitasking. Imagine the frustration of having to constantly break the connection in chat to go look at a site or work on a post. It’s frustrating, let me tell you. The idea of jumping into and out of applications — of having to actually quit an app to move to another one — is an incredibly outmoded and foreign idea in 2009 […] Funnily, the Safari experience provides better multitasking than the phone itself.</p>

<p>That last point is a good one. Safari itself allows you to keep multiple “apps” open at once. The rest of the phone does not.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tweetdeck.com/iphone/">iPhone version of Tweetdeck</a> has an interface that looks an awful lot like the Pre, by the way. Will Apple be forced to adopt such an approach?</p>
