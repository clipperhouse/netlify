As with all things portable, battery life is the limiting factor. Only about 4 hours of active usage. A bit of research shows that you can power it from the wall or from your laptop USB to get a bit more time." />

<p>As with all things portable, battery life is the limiting factor. Only about 4 hours of active usage. A bit of <a href="http://b2b.vzw.com/broadband/mobilehotspot.html">research</a> shows that you can power it from the wall or from your laptop USB to get a bit more time.</p>

<p>I am picturing this for offsite meetings and such. You’d have to be a road warrior to justify an extra $60 a month, so it’s a corporate play, imho. But you’d get some pretty serious nerd cred if you’re hanging at a conference or some such.</p>

<p>My birthday is in December. Just sayin’.</p>
