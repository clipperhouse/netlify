<p>Here’s a habit that may help to reduce the complexity of your dependency injection tree. Ask yourself: <strong>how much of an injected dependency</strong> are you actually using?</p>

<p>The conversation goes like this…</p>

<h4 id="i-need-to-inject-an-httpcontext">I need to inject an HttpContext</h4>

<p>Great. Why? Because we need to read a cookie. So really….</p>

<h4 id="ah-ok-i-only-need-to-inject-an-httprequest">Ah, OK I only need to inject an HttpRequest</h4>

<p>Better! But seriously, are you only looking at cookies?</p>

<h4 id="right-i-only-ever-touch-request-cookies-which-is-an-httpcookiecollection">Right, I only ever touch Request.Cookies, which is an HttpCookieCollection</h4>

<p>Now we are getting somewhere! You only need an <em>HttpCookieCollection</em>. That’s a pretty simple data type.</p>

<p>If that’s all you need, you don’t need to <em>inject</em> it at all — just pass it as an <strong>argument</strong> to the method that needs it.</p>

<p>Further, you likely don’t need to mock it (in the mocking-framework sense) for testing. Just new one up and add some test values. Nice!</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>You could push it further and say, OK, which of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpcookiecollection%28v=vs.110%29.aspx"><em>CookieCollection’s</em> methods</a> am I actually using? Is there an <strong>even smaller type</strong> that I could accept, maybe an <em>IEnumerable&lt;HttpCookie&gt;</em>? How about just the <em>HttpCookie</em>, no collection at all? A <em>string</em>, even?</p>

<p>The smaller the interface, the easier the mock — though there may be a trade-off in asking the caller to do more work.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Now: does your service have state, or more precisely, do its methods depend on the service’s state? If not, the method can — and likely should — be static. One less dependency on injection, one hopes.</p>
