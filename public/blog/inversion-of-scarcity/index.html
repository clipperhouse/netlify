This is what is usually meant by the catchphrase “disruption.”</p>

<p>What often happens, subtly, is that the locus of scarcity is reversed — in the consumer’s favor.</p>

<p>Consider information businesses, like newspapers, classified ads, Bloomberg, and even employment agencies. It used to be that the information they supplied was scarce. Thus a consumer might reasonably pay for access for such “rare” goods.</p>

<p>As information has become ubiquitous, its scarcity obviously falls away, and with it the pricing power of gatekeepers. But note the complementary phenomenon…</p>

<p>This information abundance has made consumers’ attention proportionally more scarce. The market has flipped.</p>

<p>The ability to reach smart, desirable people has become much more difficult. This is a common complaint among advertisers, and perhaps it’s not new.</p>

<p>What they should understand is that consumers’ attention is now a <em>very</em> liquid market. Good deals are scarce, and by “good deal” I mean underpriced eyeballs.</p>

<p>Advertisers might (and do) try ever more-invasive techniques. It can work tactically. But those eyeballs have choices, and invasive ads will turn many away.</p>

<p>Inevitably, the eyeballs will become more expensive for advertisers. They’ll need to pony up — either in $$, or in the creation of valuable content.</p>

<p>Consumers may gripe about advertisers’ desperate moves, but it should be understood as a sign of the consumer’s strength. They are an abundance of suitors.</p>
