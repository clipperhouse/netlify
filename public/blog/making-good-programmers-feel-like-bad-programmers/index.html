<div class="post-content"><p>A web developer friend of mine has been doing a lot of backend-integration-type work over the last year, and has therefore has not been developing web sites. He made a point of wading back in to the web this week, so as not to get too “rusty”, in his words.</p>

<p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5115SW8FP3L._SL500_AA280_.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>He is working in ASP.net <a href="http://www.west-wind.com/WebLog/posts/198731.aspx">Web Forms</a> — and the wading did not go well. He is struggling to do what he considers basic stuff like toggling between an edit form and a detail view.</p>

<p>Now, he’s been doing web work since the mid-90’s, when the tools were extremely raw. He knows web apps. And right now he feels like an idiot.</p>

<p>Is he as rusty as he says? No. The problem is the abstraction layer that is Web Forms. It was designed for people who don’t know how the web works; it abstracts away all the request-response stuff in an attempt to achieve a desktop-app metaphor.</p>

<p>Sadly, for all its sophistication, it can feel like <strong>doing surgery while wearing boxing gloves</strong>.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> know how the web works, you may find this abstraction hurts more than it helps. Knowing “when” a piece of code will execute under Web Forms, or what an element’s value will be at the time, is mysterious. It wants you to commit completely to its event-driven metaphor — in other words, to forget what you know about the actual web.</p>

<p>If your project requires you to jump outside the metaphor, then you end up in a special circle of hell, one where some things happen as you expect them to, and others don’t. It is a classic <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">leaky abstraction</a>.</p>

<p>I say this as someone who has spent a lot of time in the web forms <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178472.aspx">page life-cycle</a>. It is quite an achievement in many ways; it opened the web to many traditional desktop developers. However, in 2009, it feels like a lot of <a href="/blog/post/Use-case-the-metric-system-or-all-that-useless-beauty.aspx">useless beauty</a>.</p>

<p>The result of such high-level abstractions is that a good programmer (like my friend) feels like a bad programmer. I suspect I’ll find him going <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">back to basics</a> soon.</p>
