      A product process is typically something like Strategy → Discovery → Specification → Build → Delivery.
We on product teams understand most of these, but many companies struggle with “strategy”. It’s often mocked, and often with reason.
What is it for? What makes a good one?
Actionable A PM, a developer, or a designer reading a strategy should think “Yes! I know what to do next.” Product should fall out of a strategy naturally and quickly.

      Here’s a habit that may help to reduce the complexity of your dependency injection tree. Ask yourself: how much of an injected dependency are you actually using?
The conversation goes like this…
I need to inject an HttpContext Great. Why? Because we need to read a cookie. So really….
Ah, OK I only need to inject an HttpRequest Better! But seriously, are you only looking at cookies?
Right, I only ever touch Request.

      It’s easy to think of key performance indicators as a task to be tacked on to the end of a project. Rather, KPIs should be understood as a product like any other, and so:
…they need strategy The person responsible for a product’s strategy will have specific hypotheses about what numbers they want to move. Key entities and concepts are described, as they will influence everything that follows.
…they need discovery This is where the PM is responsible for choosing the right KPIs, i.

      Critical to developer and company success is the idea of time well spent. Optimistically, the company’s and the dev’s incentives are aligned in this regard.
From the dev’s perspective, time well spent includes:
 Doing valuable, differentiated work Avoiding time-consuming, uninteresting barriers to work Working on things that matter Working on things that ship Showing visible progress Taking on challenges + learning  I’ll translate them into management terms:

      I made a Chrome extension which makes Twitter.com’s UX more tolerable, called decker. It:
 Widens the content area and removes the columns with “Trends” and “Who to follow”, etc. Resolves (i.e., removes) the t.co redirects. You’ll go directly to the URL in a tweet. Auto-loads new tweets instead of showing you the “N new tweets” bar. Pro tip: if you are scrolled down the page it will not auto-load new tweets, to avoid annoying scroll jumps.

      Code has a user experience. Our methods have a UX. Our data models have a UX.
The users are our colleagues, current and future. We are always on the lookout for fresh information, even anecdotal, on the success of our users.
A big UX problem is an abundance of lore. Lore is when a developer needs to hear an explanation from an elder before using a piece of code, and in the absence of such storytelling, will have a bad time.

      Nulls are a notorious source of bugs in many programming languages. Here, I sketch out a way to avoid them, using C# for illustration.
To be clear, this post is intended as habits for human programmers; it is specifically not about static analysis or language features.
Principles I submit that we can avoid a large majority of null-related errors if we follow these two principles:
 Passing a null is a programming error Branching on null is a programming error  I think most of our problems trace back to imbuing null with meaning, i.

      Versioning is, right now, merely a human label. We have helpful conventions like semver, but one still relies on human judgment as to the definition of a “notable” change.
What if the machine could detect, and perhaps describe, API changes in a meaningful way?
What I imagine is this: a program that examines a program’s API for changes, and describes them. Version control, in other words, of the sort we expect from Git.

      Apple’s ad blocking API is good for users and bad for Google, in 3 ways:
1: Blocking ads, of course This is the most direct way that Apple’s API is bad for Google: more mobile users can block ads, which are the basis of Google’s business.
(That said, the economics are such that it will not be a linear relationship between “ads blocked” and “$ lost”, due to the incredible wastefulness of the status quo.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      It appears that Internet advertising is going through a bit of a shakeout. Ad blocking is becoming more pervasive (perhaps 30% of users), and a study by Google indicates that as many as 50% of ad “impressions” are never actually put in front of a human being.
For those that rely on ad revenues in their business, this might seem like a reason for panic. I don’t know if it is!
