<p>Critical to developer and company success is the idea of <strong>time well spent</strong>. Optimistically, the company’s and the dev’s incentives are aligned in this regard.</p>

<p>From the dev’s perspective, time well spent includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Doing valuable, differentiated work</li>
<li>Avoiding time-consuming, uninteresting barriers to work</li>
<li>Working on things that matter</li>
<li>Working on things that ship</li>
<li>Showing visible progress</li>
<li>Taking on challenges + learning</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll translate them into management terms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Knowing where original (“invented here”) programming makes sense</li>
<li>Minimizing talent’s exposure to bureaucratic + process concerns</li>
<li>Articulating priorities before committing resources</li>
<li>Removing barriers to shipping; failing fast</li>
<li>Insisting on iteration and communication</li>
<li>Knowing each developers’ strengths, motivations and desires for the future</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="aligned-interests">Aligned interests</h4>

<p>There’s a classic idea of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem">principal-agent problem</a>, where one works to align an employee’s interest with the company’s. We are lucky in tech that, imho, our interests are very similar.</p>

<p>Developers are high on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow’s hierarchy</a>, which is to say, our material concerns are so well addressed that we focus more on happiness and fulfillment in our work.</p>

<p>This rarified place on the hierarchy means that devs can choose to do things that are interesting and impactful. We want our efforts to be visible, relevant, and well-received.</p>

<p>Guess what? The company wants these things as well. The company wants products to ship, to be useful, and to sell.</p>

<h4 id="time-as-a-hypothesis">Time as a hypothesis</h4>

<p>Most organizations are <em>merely OK</em> at using employees’ time well. Even in tech, with all our rigor and openness, it’s possible to spend hundreds of developer hours with little to show.</p>

<p>(My go-to image of devaluing human time is the DMV.)</p>

<p>We should consider allocation of resources to be a hypothesis of its own; we should characterize what outcome we expect, and how to measure it (even if anecdotal). We should recognize opportunity costs.</p>

<p>Work can be speculative, and outcomes can be subjective — these are fine things! — but we should work hard to define and demonstrate the best use of talent’s time.</p>
