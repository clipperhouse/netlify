I didn’t see any ship dates so I guess they are making their way into the sales channel now.</p>

<p>Since the new ones and the old ones share the X25-M model name, you’ll want to know which one you are getting.</p>

<p>To get the new ones, you’ll want to look for a “G2” at the end of the model name. For example, the 2.5” 80GB new (34nm) version is SSDSA2MH080<strong>G2</strong>, whereas the previous (50nm) equivalent is SSDSA2MH080<strong>G1</strong>.</p>
