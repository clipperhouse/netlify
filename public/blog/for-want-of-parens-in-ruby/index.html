The opportunities to create tight, readable code are impressive. More than other languages, it affords the opportunity to make code look like what it does.</p>

<p>One syntactic wart, however, is functions. I’ll make an analogy with JavaScript, where
<code>myFunction()</code></p>

<p><em>executes</em> myFunction, while
<code>myFunction</code></p>

<p>is a variable that <em>refers</em> to the function, that can be passed as, say, a callback. In Ruby, parentheses around method arguments are optional, such that
<code>my_thing.do_something one_argument, another_argument</code></p>

<p>is the same as
<code>my_thing.do_something(one_argument, another_argument)</code></p>

<p>I can understand this as a cosmetic choice — fewer delimiters, less noise. However, it makes passing functions as arguments unfortunately ugly.</p>

<p>Because there is no distinction between parens and not, simply referring to a function becomes non-trivial. As a result, if one wants to use a functional style, there are hoops.</p>

<p>Now, I’m a noob (Nuby?) so there’s no doubt that I am missing something idiomatic. But I see no fewer than 4 ways in Ruby to pass a function, none of which strike me as pretty. There are blocks, which are good for anonymous functions, such as:
<code>array.map{ |x| x * 2 }</code></p>

<p>That ain’t bad, but naming and reusing it is less than obvious. (Again, I’m a noob, correct me.) Another approach is a do block:
<code>form_for my_model do |f|  
 f.stuff  
 f.things  
end</code></p>

<p>There are Proc’s which explicitly say, make this a function:
<code>my_func = Proc.new { |x| x * 2 }</code></p>

<p>And not least, a lambda keyword:
<code>my_lamb = lambda { |x| x * 2 }</code></p>

<p>Further, for lack of parens, we can’t simply my_func(5), we have to my_func.call(5).</p>

<p>There are subtle and <a href="http://www.robertsosinski.com/2008/12/21/understanding-ruby-blocks-procs-and-lambdas/">reasonable differences</a> for these things. A method is not a proc, is not a lambda. And there are <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Proc.html">idioms</a> for hiding the ugly.</p>

<p>But for a language a beautiful as Ruby, and for a person coming from C# or JavaScript, this is surprisingly baroque.</p>
