It’s intended as a lightweight operating system built primarily for hosting a browser.</p>

<p>The post is short on specifics, mostly mentioning goals. I think it sounds very attractive — I only write web apps these days and know very few people who don’t. But will it get traction?</p>

<p>I think out of the gate, it will be slow going. After all, if you (as a user) want to live on the web, you have that ability now. You just fire up a web browser, be it on a laptop or a mobile phone.</p>

<p>The question is whether the Chrome netbook <strong>adds to the number of devices you carry</strong>. In other words, will it be enough for a person to abandon their laptop on, say, a business trip?</p>

<p>I fear that perhaps Chrome OS serves an undefined middle ground. If you want business-class computing, you’ll carry a laptop. If you want super portability, you’ll carry an iPhone/Android/Blackberry. In both cases, you have everything that Chrome would do, plus all the other capabilities of those devices.</p>

<p>Its resource-lightness is attractive — Chrome netbooks will probably boast impressive battery life and low cost.</p>

<p>But by stripping out much of the Linux stack to focus on the browser, Chrome OS will likely preclude certain killer apps like voice-over-IP (eg Skype) and the current wave of robust Twitter clients (eg Tweetdeck). The iPhone’s momentum is being fueled by its native, non-browser apps.</p>

<p>I’d like to see how Chrome handles user-generated media too. Will it have a photo library or video editing? It certainly <em>could</em>. But then it starts to look like a regular, resource-intensive OS. Remember, Windows 7 and Mac OS X Snow Leopard are both focusing on performance, battery life and boot time.</p>

<p>Here’s a thought: <strong>maybe this is the cafe/conference computer</strong>. If you are out and around, keeping an eye on email, and blogging/twittering, this might be the solution. If you know that your “real” computer is back at the apartment/hotel, you might be willing to step out for a few hours with this one.</p>

<p>It’s a worthwhile experiment. I think it remains to be seen who it’s for.</p>
