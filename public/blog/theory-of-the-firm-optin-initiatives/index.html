<div class="post-content"><p>I’ve become adamant about making internal initiatives opt-in for the following reason: it brings more information to bear.</p>

<p>For example, at Stack, I started something called “Ask a Nerd”. The goal is to create a channel of communication between our sales people and our developers.</p>

<p>Now, I might easily have pushed for compelling all developers and sales people to participate. It stands to reason: if it’s a good idea, everyone should be part of it. It’s a <em>company</em> initiative.</p>

<p>But I didn’t push in this way. Rather, I communicated the idea and made it opt-in on all sides. This has several advantages.</p>

<p>First, it allows the initiative to get off the ground with as little drag as possible. Had I wanted to compel participation, I’d have needed more permission and consensus.</p>

<p>Second, it’s an ongoing test. Growth, or lack thereof, is apparent in the participation numbers; participation becomes a proxy for value creation. The onus is on me to improve the product and sell it.</p>

<p>Third, it selects for people who are interested in the idea. It reveals hidden leadership and undiscovered skills.</p>

<p>And fourth, frankly, it’s safer. It’s allowed to die at a small cost, whereas a mandatory initiative risks being propped up to prevent embarrassment.</p>

<p>Had participation in the initiative been mandatory, a lot of information would have been muted. We’d have optimized not for creating the most value, but for having a successful initiative. See the difference?</p>

<p>Put another way, mandatory participation becomes a test of a fairly static <em>a priori</em> idea. Opt-in means we start from a kernel, and evolve.</p>
