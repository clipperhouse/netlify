After many interactions, I noticed that my productivity, my happiness, my motivation consistently were diminished after dealing with them.</p>

<p>I found that I came out of these conversations feeling more burdened than I had going in.</p>

<p>I noticed with certain other people, our conversations were the opposite — I came away with fewer problems, or a new perspective, or food for thought, or feeling freshly challenged.</p>

<p>Once I came to notice this pattern, I resolved to be the latter person. This means optimizing conversations for the <strong>other person being glad that they dealt with you</strong>. This can take many forms, some more tangible than others.</p>

<p>The most tangible form, perhaps, is where you say “I’ll take care of it”, and it’s true, and they leave with a lesser burden. But it takes many other forms.</p>

<p>At Stack, for example, I’ve become a bit of a <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/">rubber ducky</a> lately. There are several people — programmers and otherwise — who seek me out when they want to talk through technical or product challenges.</p>

<p>Now, I am very good programmer working at a place where the other programmers are <em>more</em> than very good. It’s unlikely that I’ll tell them what code to write.</p>

<p>But I might help them characterize the problem differently than they are currently doing. Maybe it’s a compression problem, or a caching problem, or a type problem, or a separation of concerns problem, but they haven’t recognized it as such.</p>

<p>More likely, I’ll nod and ask leading questions. Not because I am trying to lead anywhere in particular, and not because I know the answer, but because I want to lead them away from the rut they are in. I am optimizing for the other person articulating their problem, in the hope they might solve it.</p>

<p>But these are just examples. The point is to think creatively and empathetically about why a person started a conversation with you. Make it profitable.</p>
