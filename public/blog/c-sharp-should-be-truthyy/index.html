<p>I’d love to see something similar in C# — not truthiness, but an implicit test for existence.</p>

<p>Every object in C# has a ToString method. What if every object had a similar Exists method? The compiler could simply interpret if (object) — or any boolean expression — to the Exists() value, without requiring the developer to type it out.</p>

<p>The default implementation, from which every class would inherit, would be this != null. Yes, the current syntax wouldn’t support that evaluation (one can’t call a method on a null). The trickery would be akin to extension methods. Syntactic sugar, yes.</p>

<p>Like ToString, it might be overridden, depending on how one defines a legitimate value for their particular class. Doing so is fraught with danger if one goes about changing it a lot (careful with that axe, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMpGdG27K9o">Eugene</a>).</p>

<p>I would only support this idea for Object and Nullable&lt;T&gt;. And note this is not truthiness — it’s an <strong>explicit definition with a sensible default</strong>. Thoughts?</p>
