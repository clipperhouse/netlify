For example, environmental protection is conservative. Preferring traditional marriage is conservative.

    <main class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Fred Wilson makes the argument (<a href="http://avc.com/2014/11/internet-freedom-2/">here</a> and <a href="http://avc.com/2014/11/the-cable-model-and-the-internet-model/">here</a>) that net neutrality is a conservative idea. That’s correct, and that’s the problem.</p>

<p>My definition of “conservative” is “seeking to preserve accreted value”. It fights change, because change is considered dangerous. It is (perhaps rational) risk-aversion and loss-aversion.</p>

<p>For example, environmental protection is conservative. Preferring traditional marriage is conservative.</p>

<p>(You’ll note that people who support those respective ideas are not typically found within the same political tribe, which is my semantic point.)</p>

<p>Net neutrality wishes to “preserve the internet”. It wishes to lock in a certain model, believing that one is protecting value.</p>

<p>But the internet is not conservative. It allows for many unpredictable outcomes. It is emergent and adaptive.</p>

<p>To me, neutrality locks in the worst of the internet (last-mile monopoly) while hindering its best qualities (routing around damage).</p>

<p>Imagine it’s 1996, the internet is emergent. It is largely designed around discrete text protocols — email and HTTP and such. Binary data is supported, but pipes are narrow.</p>

<p>Now, companies start popping up to stream video over that network. Video was not considered in the network’s design — in 1996, video over IP is wildly inefficient. Coax cables can stream dozens of (analog) channels, but that modem on the phone line? Not so much.</p>

<p>So netizens quite reasonably wish to prevent this change. Imagine if bandwidth-hungry video providers crowd out those of us sending email! It’s an abuse of the network, greedy, and a departure from history. At the very least, the FCC should step in.</p>

<p>That’s a conservative case, and it looks a lot like the argument we are having today.</p>
