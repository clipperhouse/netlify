<div class="post-content"><p>If Firefox were a stock, I’d be <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/10/chrome-firefox/">shorting it</a>. That’s what I said a <a href="/blog/post/Firefox-has-a-user-base-does-it-have-a-future.aspx">few months ago</a>, too, and one of the Mozilla guys took issue.</p>

<p>I’ll say it again: what Firefox has is a user base, not a future. It’s not unlike Microsoft right now — their success is based on momentum, not new converts. (If Microsoft and Apple were to emerge from the womb today, who would win?)</p>

<p>Firefox’s user base does not have a lot of <strong>new</strong> growth ahead of it, unless Mozilla does something radical. The reason is that FF’s differentiators are falling by the wayside.</p>

<p>The biggest threat is Chrome. It’s not that Chrome is going to have dramatic market share numbers. But they are the <strong>first viable competition that FF has ever had in the “non-bundled browser” space.</strong> A market going from “one” to “two” is a big change. So Chrome will capture a lot of growth (and techie mindshare) at FF’s expense.</p>

<p>FF’s second differentiator is that it is seamlessly cross-platform. With Google’s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/08/google-chrome-mac-here/">announcement</a> of Chrome for Mac and Linux, this bit of difference is going away. (The stuff is still beta but I expect rapid development.)</p>

<p>Third, as linked above, are extensions. End-users care about these, and until now only FF had a viable ecosystem. I would even argue that FF’s add-ons served something of a “lock-in” function among certain consumers: they might not care about the browser per se, but they love their little weather widget or iTunes controller.</p>

<p>Fourth, Windows 7. It’s not that people love IE. But IE 8 doesn’t suck, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/11/18/an-early-look-at-ie9-for-developers.aspx">IE 9</a> will not-suck more. So for the majority of consumers who care about “good enough”, IE is increasingly good-enough-er.</p>
