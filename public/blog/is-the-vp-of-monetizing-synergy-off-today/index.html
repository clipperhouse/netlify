    <main class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>So, I’m a bit surprised that the upcoming <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5070055/microsoft-bringing-office-suite-online">Web version</a> of Office isn’t based on Silverlight (Microsoft’s “rich internet application” framework). Instead, it appears that it will be browser-native, which is to say, <a href="/blog/post/Javascript-is-now-strategic-for-Microsoft.aspx">written in Javascript</a>.</p>

<p>From a Microsoft corporate perspective, this seems like it would be a perfect opportunity to promote Silverlight. As a relatively new platform, Silverlight’s biggest challenge is getting a widespread installed base. There will presumably be <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/27/ballmer-says-windows-installed-base-will-top-a-billion-by-the-en/">millions of people</a> who wish to use the Web version of Office. Requiring them to install Silverlight would widen that base considerably.</p>

<p>It’s like any other “killer app” strategy: regular folks need a real benefit to adopt a new platform. My parents use the Internet because of email, for example. Thus far, Silverlight’s killer apps have been exclusive video content like the Olympics and Netflix.</p>

<p>If millions of new users adopt Silverlight to get Office, that’s big.</p>

<p>Further, from a technical perspective, an application as sophisticated as Office would certainly be easier to develop in C#, and probably more performant.</p>

<p>But Microsoft didn’t choose this route. They went Web-native. I can see why certain folks (like Mozilla and Google) would be thrilled by this. And for an end-user, a no-install approach is arguably a bit easier. Hey, I prefer to keep everything right in the browser, too.</p>

<p>But from MS’ perspective, those seem like small wins. I wonder how those conversations went up in Redmond. Was the VP of Synergy off that day?</p>
