			<h1>Ad blocking, like piracy, is a market phenomenon</h1>
			<div>
				<p>A French ISP has started <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/technology/ad-blocking-raises-alarm-among-firms-like-google.html">blocking ads</a> at the router level for its customers, enabled by default. Advertisers are, not surprisingly, upset.</p>
<p>What Free.fr is doing will probably not turn out to be legal. It’s clearly meant as a poke in the eye to content-driven advertisers like Google. It ensures a re-arguing of net neutrality.</p>
<p><strong>What I haven’t heard is any objection by users.</strong> The move is, politics aside, a differentiator for the ISP’s service. It’s a product decision.</p>
<p>If consumers aren’t objecting, that tells me ad-blocking is an economic positive as judged by the market. It’s not unlike music piracy in the days of Napster: illegal, damaging to suppliers, but desired by consumers.</p>
<p>So a reasonable analysis would be not unlike Steve Jobs’ understanding of music piracy: a huge market signal to offer a better product.</p>
<p>Sadly, I am sure regulators will not allow it to stand. That’s a shame — I’d rather see customers vote with their wallets, and let Free and Google fight it out, ie, negotiate.</p>
<p>The Internet works because it is a voluntary system. Big ISPs peer with one another, often without money changing hands.</p>
<p>It’s inevitable that “peering” arrangements will also need to be made between content providers and ISPs. I’ve said in the past that the <a href="http://clipperhouse.com/2012/08/01/the-quaintness-of-content-vs-infrastructure/">distinction between “content” and “infrastructure” is spurious</a>, an accident of history.</p>
<p>Let’s have them sort it out. That’s what progress looks like.</p>
